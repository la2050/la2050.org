	<a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/convergence-creative-solutions/">Convergence Creative Solutions</a> proposed building an online community around the LA2050 goals of LEARN, CREATE, PLAY, CONNECT, and LIVE. The organization would host virtual summits to build community around these ideas as well as a live festival celebration of Los Angeles.
