<p><p>This Book Lovers Day we got help from our staff to create a list of our own bookshelf favorites! Here are our must-haves to add to your own book collection:</p><p><strong><em>The Overstory: A Novel</em> by Richard Powers</strong></p><p>Goldhirsh Foundation President Tara Roth admitted she cried in public while reading this Pulitzer Prize winning book. “It's just a beautiful and sad story. You become immersed in all the character's stories and truly care about them."</p><p><strong><em>Sula</em> by Toni Morrison</strong></p><p>Tara also recommends this novel that chronicles the friendship of two women over their lifetimes. By taking the characters through different paths in life, Morrison shows what it's like to be a black woman in America. </p><p><strong><em>A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-tested Strategy for Successful Investing</em> by Burton G. Malkiel </strong></p><p>Social Innovation Coordinator LeAnn Kelch recommends this book about investing. “As someone who is just starting out in my career, I wanted to learn about how I could (and should) be investing my money. This book is helpful for those who are looking for more than just simple advice and want to understand not just <em>what</em> they should do with their investments, but <em>why</em>. I've learned so much!"</p><p><img src="https://la2050.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/comfy/cms/files/139/files/original/TheColorofLaw.png" style="width: 204px; height: 204px;" rel="width: 204px; height: 204px;"></p><p><strong><em>The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America</em> by Richard Rothstein </strong></p><p>LeAnn also recommends this book that traces the history and lasting impact of redlining in America - revealing how the government imposed residential segregation and “contributed greatly to our country's pervasive racial and economic inequality." </p><p><strong><em>Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now</em> by Maya Angelou</strong></p><p>From racism, to grieving, to taking time for your own self care, Ms. Angelou gives her raw, real advice to apply to everyday life. “The wisdom, wit, and honesty from her personal experiences helped me learn to love my journey for what it is and take control of it," according to our intern Amanda Guiterrez.</p><p><strong><em><img src="https://la2050.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/comfy/cms/files/138/files/original/GmorningGnight.png" style="width: 197px; height: 197px;" rel="width: 197px; height: 197px;"></em></strong></p><p><strong><em>G'morning, G'night!: Little Pep Talks for Me &amp; You</em> by Lin-Manuel Miranda </strong></p><p>Amanda also recommends starting your day with Lin-Manuel Miranda's brand of sunshine, “These little affirmations start my day off with motivation and end my night with contentment, and truly make me smile." </p><p><strong><em>Becoming</em> by Michelle Obama</strong></p><p>In this book, Obama shares how her experiences growing up in the South Side of Chicago shaped her career and personal life, along with her experiences as first lady. USC Price Fellow Claudia Eccheveria says, “Michelle Obama's memoir is a must read!" </p><p><strong><em>Peace in the Hood: Working with Gang Members to End the Violence</em> by Aquil Basheer and Christina Hoag </strong></p><p>Claudia also recommends this book that provides guidelines on how to become an interventionist and promote peace in some of LA's most vulnerable neighborhoods impacted by gang violence. </p><p><strong><em><img src="https://la2050.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/comfy/cms/files/137/files/original/AskMore.png" style="width: 211px; height: 211px;" rel="width: 211px; height: 211px;"></em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Ask More: The Power of Questions to Open Doors, Uncover Solutions and Spark Change</em> by Frank Sesno </strong></p><p>Consultant Julie Lacouture says this book by journalist Frank Sesno “has some amazing advice about how to ask great questions to spark change. I learned the difference between empathetic questions, accountability questions, diagnostic questions, and when to best use them."</p><p><strong><em>Rising Out of Hatred: The Awakening of a Former White Nationalist</em> by Eli Saslow</strong></p><p>Julie also recommends this book that follows a young man who "grew up at the epicenter of white nationalism" (his Dad founded Stormfront and his godfather is David Duke) and came to renounce all of it after attending a small college in Florida. Says Julie: “This is a tremendous story of how small influences can make a huge change and how white-supremacist ideas get repackaged and adopted." </p><p><strong><em>Here (Pantheon Graphic Library)</em> by Richard McGuire</strong></p><p>This graphic novel is recommended by intern Amanda Liaw, “It's a surprising book that illustrates the stories that have taken place in the corner of a single room across hundreds and thousands of years. It does an amazing job at drawing out the deep emotional connection we somehow feel to spaces."</p><p><strong><em>Outliers: The Story of Success</em> by Malcolm Gladwell</strong></p><p>Intern Amy Roth recommends this non-fiction book, “Gladwell's narrative of the complexities of “outliers" in society is gripping and thought-provoking."</p><p><strong><em>The Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America</em> by Timothy Snyder</strong></p><p>Amy also recommends this detailed analysis to draw parallels between history and the present, as he maps out the road to corruption, censorship, and the suppression of democracy throughout Russia's quest for world domination. </p></p>

	On June 7, our timelines looked more orange than usual as thousands of you took a stand for gun safety by participating in the Wear Orange campaign. One of our My LA2050 grantees, the 
	<a href="https://archive.la2050.org/the-brady-center-to-prevent-gun-violence/">Brady Center to prevent Gun Violence</a> took part and we were touched by this story from one of their employees:
</p>
<p>
	<br>
</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
	Our Vice President of Policy Christian Heyne wears orange for his mom, Jan, who was shot and killed 14 years ago. <br>

	Today, we're thinking of Christian, his family, and all of the families like his. We must do more to end gun violence in America. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WearOrange?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WearOrange</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NotOneMore?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NotOneMore</a> <a href="https://t.co/pCvQ2Ys42Q">pic.twitter.com/pCvQ2Ys42Q</a><br>

<p>
	The Wear Orange campaign is an annual 
	<a href="https://wearorange.org/supporters/">collaborative</a> project from hundreds of nonprofits, media organizations, and influencers across the country. The viral campaign picked orange as its color in memory of Hadiya Pendleton, age 15, who was shot and killed just one week after performing at President Obama's 2nd inaugural parade in 2013. After her death, her friends marched in orange, her favorite color, to bring awareness to gun violence.

<p><p>
	<em>Written by United Way of Greater Los Angeles</em><em>, in partnership with Inner City Law Center and Abundant Housing LA, and provided to LA2050 as part of its mid-year report.</em><br>
</p><p>
	United Way's Everyone In campaign is committed to educating and activating 100,000 residents across LA County to connect the dots between housing affordability and our current homelessness crisis. There are more than 52,000 people experiencing homelessness and thousands more who are just one paycheck, crisis, or emergency away from losing their home. The high cost of housing, stagnant wages, and lack of affordable units only exacerbate the problem. We need to build more supportive housing and bring in those that are at most risk of dying on our streets.
	<br>
</p><p>
	After receiving the LA2050 Activation Challenge award, Everyone In has been ramping up efforts to activate local residents around real solutions to end homelessness. Our field organizing campaign is strengthening our work as we partner with more community-based groups, meet with stakeholders, and receive endorsements from local organizations, faith communities, and small businesses. Each week, more people sign up for the campaign by engaging with us online, participating in trainings, and attending town hall meetings. We have invested more resources in canvassing, phone banking, mass texting, and call-in trainings – tightly coordinated with our digital media and engagement strategy.
</p><hr><p style="text-align: center;">

</p><p style="text-align: center;">
	<em>NEARLY DOUBLED SINCE AUGUST 1, 2018</em>
</p><hr><p>
	In the inaugural year of the campaign, most of our efforts in siting and approving interim and permanent housing were focused in the City of Los Angeles. Our organizers have been actively building community support around 23 Proposition HHH-funded supportive housing and 12 bridge housing developments. We are also working on an additional five supportive housing developments in L.A. County.
</p><p>
	With the support of the Goldhirsh Foundation and LA2050, we are expanding our organizing and advocacy capacity to reach all 88 cities across the County. This is no small feat. To start, we are targeting seven jurisdictions and building strategy based on their current policies on housing, available resources, and public/political support on the ground.
	<br>
</p><p>
	In the first phase of the LA2050 grant, Everyone In set up planning meetings with our partners, Abundant Housing LA and Inner City Law Center to develop a policy and legal approach to streamlining development and preventing homelessness through a “right to counsel" ordinance for tenants facing eviction. The ordinance would guarantee tenants have access to the information and representation they need when faced with landlord harassment, eviction, and other issues. An average of 54,239 unlawful detainer eviction cases have been filed per year over the last three years in Los Angeles County. The 2018 Homeless Count showed over 9,000 people experienced homelessness for the first time based on the combined impacts of evictions and rental housing unaffordability.

	In the next six months, we will be creating and executing city-specific strategies that will propose policy improvements to increase the supply of affordable and supportive housing. We will conduct a series of workshops to educate elected offices, stakeholders, and residents on policy recommendations that can be made to address homelessness and prevention in each jurisdiction. From there, we will coordinate with the Everyone In organizer team to begin mobilizing the community support necessary to site housing and pass new policies.

The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence
</span>
</div>
<div class='blogtags'>
</div>
<div class='blogpost-shadedbox richtext'>
<p><p><em>Written by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence</em><em> and provided to LA2050 as part of its mid-year report.</em><br></p><p>
	The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence is proud to report on the Combating Crime Guns Initiative (CCGI): Los Angeles. Our Combating Crime Guns Initiative (CCGI) is a multi-pronged strategy to stem the flow of crime guns into cities that are heavily impacted by gun violence. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF), 90% of crime guns (firearms that are illegally possessed, used in a crime, or suspected to have been used in a crime) are sold by just 5% of gun dealers. Through CCGI, we are working to identify and reform gun dealers who are flooding cities with crime guns.
</p><p>
	The Brady Center is partnering with the Goldhirsh Foundation to bring CCGI to Los Angeles and help ensure that in 2050, Los Angelenos of all ages will enjoy safe homes, safe neighborhoods, and safe places to play. Under LA2050's 
	<a href="goals/play.html">'Play' goal</a>, we are focusing on two metrics: per capita crime rate, and perceived safety. Both of these are long-term measures, but we are confident in CCGI's ability to impact them over time.
</p><p>
	<strong>Progress So Far</strong>
</p><p>
	After the hiring of our Program Manager Steve Lindley, our work in Los Angeles accelerated significantly. Steve is an experienced community liaison with more than 30 years of experience in law enforcement. In the short period of time he's been with us, he's managed to accomplish a tremendous amount of work. During his first month as Program Manager, he met with the Los Angeles Mayor's Office, the Los Angeles Police Department, and the Los Angeles area Brady Chapters to introduce himself and discuss strategies to reduce gun violence in the Los Angeles area.
</p><p>
	As a result of these meetings, Steve is now assisting the Mayor's Office and Police Department in drafting three pieces of legislation aimed at providing enhanced oversight of California firearms dealers, mandatory reporting and tracing of law enforcement seized crime guns, and enhancing the gun purchasing public's knowledge of California firearm and firearm safe storage laws. These bills are essential in providing local law enforcement with the ability to effectively engage with the dealers most responsible for the flow of crime guns into Los Angeles.
</p><p>
	Steve also met with the Stockton Police Department to discuss crime gun tracing best practices and with the City of San Diego to plan Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO) trainings for local law enforcement officials. These meetings helped to establish strategies that can be used in the future when engaging with the LA City Council and law enforcement.
</p><p>
	The Brady Center has ties to many local community, faith-based, civic, and academic organizations in Los Angeles, including Women Against Gun Violence, Moms Demand Action, Violence Prevention Coalition of Greater Los, USC School of Social Work, the UCLA School of Public Health, All Saints Episcopal, Beth Shir Shalom, and First AME. This coalition of Los Angeles community partners has grown since we brought CCGI to Los Angeles. Key new partners include the Youth Council to End Gun Violence, Hope and Heal Fund, and the Urban Peace Institute of LA. These partners are essential to both amplifying our work and activating more individuals in the gun violence prevention movement.
</p><p>
	<strong>Challenges</strong>
</p><p>
	Political and legislative restrictions have been a central hurdle. The corporate gun lobby and gun industry have ensured that there are many limitations to local law enforcement's ability to publicly release information on crime gun dealers. Our 
	<a href="http://www.bradycampaign.org/legal-action-project">legal team</a> has been and will continue to be instrumental in overcoming this challenge.
</p><p>
	<strong>What's to Come</strong>
</p><p>
	In the next six months, the Brady Center will work closely with the California Department of Justice and the ATF to obtain crime gun trace data for Los Angeles. We will also be expanding our local coalition through numerous meetings and collaborative community education events. These community education sessions will serve to inform Los Angeles residents about the landscape of crime guns and gun violence in their city and spur grassroots activism within the local gun violence prevention movement.
</p><p>
	Additionally, we will continue our work with law enforcement agencies and lawmakers to roll out legislation that will help reduce gun violence. One potential law on the horizon will enforce that all firearms seized from criminals will be entered into the AFS system so that they can be traced back to their source. Once we gain access to Los Angeles gun trace data, our team and our local crime guns partners will share this information with the public and coordinate organized legal and financial pressure against the most notorious California dealers to motivate the reformation of their dangerous business practices.
</p><p>
	This is just the beginning. Everyone has a part to play in preventing gun violence in our communities, and we urge Los Angelenos and local community organizations to reach out to Steve Lindley (at 
	<a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#daa9b6b3b4beb6bfae9ab8a8bbbea3b7bbb3b6f4b5a8bd"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7e0d1217101a121b073e1c0c1f1a07131f171250110c19">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>) to become part of the solution. Let's play, Los Angeles!

LA Street Vendor Campaign
</span>
</div>
<div class='blogtags'>
</div>
<div class='blogpost-shadedbox richtext'>
<p><p>
	<em>Written by the LA Street Vendor Campaign, a collaboration between ELACC, LURN, LA Food Policy Council, and Public Counsel, and provided to LA2050 as part of their mid-year report.</em>
</p><p>
	The second half of 2018 was monumental for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LAStreetVendorCampaign/">LA Street Vendor Campaign</a> with the LA City Council's historic vote to legalize street vending in the City through a permit process. Just a couple months before the City of LA's vote, Governor Brown signed into law SB946 Safe Sidewalk Vending Act (Lara), which legalized vending statewide. These two significant milestones in the street vending movement came after nearly a decade of advocacy from thousands of street vendors and their supporters.
</p><p>
	The impact of this legislation is huge. Over 50,000 street vendors operate in Los Angeles alone, representing a $504 million industry. Approximately 80 percent of street vendors are women of color who contribute to the rich, diverse street food landscape through the informal economy — and when allowed to do their work legally and safely — contribute to the vitality of their neighborhoods and LA as a whole.
</p><p>
	The Los Angeles Street Vendor Campaign has always been about both protecting the rights and dignity of some of the most vulnerable workers in the city, and providing them with greater economic opportunity.
</p><p>
	Our LA2050 activation has three main pathways to engage over 100,000 Angelenos in supporting a more inclusive economy. 1) dynamic public outreach campaign on social media informing Angelenos about street vending; 2) in person participation at public hearings, events and activities; 3) direct action by participating in a #supportLAstreetvendors #buycott.
</p><p>
	We connected the #buycott to Small Business Saturday 2018, engaging 40,879 followers on twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. More than 400 street vendors, allies, and supporters filled the LA City Hall Chamber on November 28th, 2018 for the historic vote and then celebrated on City Hall South's steps, chanting “Si Se Pudo."
</p><p>
	Through the in-person participation and social media activation led by campaign anchor partners <a href="http://www.elacc.org/">East LA Community Corporation</a> (ELACC), <a href="http://lurnetwork.org/">Leadership for Urban Renewal Network</a> (LURN), <a href="https://www.goodfoodla.org/">Los Angeles Food Policy Council</a> (LAFPC), and <a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/">Public Counsel</a>, over 40,000 Angelenos were activated and engaged in making their city a place where street vendors can thrive. The LA Street Vendor Campaign is reaching people across the country with nationwide coverage including the New York Times with a photo journal story: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/11/multimedia/la-street-vendors.html">L.A. Street Sellers Outlawed No More</a>.
</p><p>
	However, our journey to build an inclusive economy for our community doesn't end with these monumental wins. We will continue to fight for a City that values and supports street vendors with the best possible policies, and sees them as contributors to the economic and cultural tapestry of Los Angeles.
</p><p>
	In 2019, we continue our community organizing with street vendors to ensure the City of Los Angeles permit regulations are fair and inclusive. Efforts will include outreach to vendors across the Los Angeles region to ensure they know their rights under SB946 Safe Sidewalk Vending Act (Lara). Additional goals include incentivizing vendors to sell healthy food in neighborhoods without access to fresh fruits and vegetables and developing a stronger non-profit infrastructure to support merchants, such as partnerships that legitimize vendors within farmer's markets across the City.
</p><p>
	We have also begun engaging the local business community. Over the last few months, our team has been working closely with the County Health Department and local manufacturers to design affordable food carts that vendors could use as part of the new regulatory system. We've also been working together with our public sector partners to plan how we can make sure there is a clear pathway for vendors to comply with new “rules and regulations" so they can comfortably enter the formal economy and participate in Los Angeles' economy as important stakeholders. This work will be a priority for 2019. To create a truly inclusive economy, we believe we must work with public, private, and nonprofit partners.
</p><p>
	In an era where more of our workforce is in the informal economy with zero protections and safety nets for emergencies, organizing for a street vendor movement is critical to building local solutions that can scale up and reach thousands of precarious workers across Los Angeles and beyond.

</p><p>
	We're thrilled to share this incredible milestone with everyone involved in the <a href="/">LA2050</a> Activation Challenge. This grant allows us to activate Angelenos to engage in and build an inclusive economy that supports thousands of workers, whose entrepreneurship contributes to our neighborhood economies and cultural landscape.

<p><p> <em>Written by CISE and provided to LA2050 as part of its mid-year report.</em></p><p>As part of the LA2050 Activation Challenge, the Center for Innovation in STEM Education (CISE) at CSU Dominguez Hills is empowering teachers and providing dynamic training and mentoring on the state adopted, industry recognized Next Generation Science Standards.</p><p>We are pleased to report that the first cohort of 55 teachers were trained in fall 2018. Following is a snapshot of the teachers served: </p><p>• 56% of participants were teachers from LAUSD. </p><p>• 19% of participants were teachers from Compton USD. </p><p>• 17% of participants were teachers from Inglewood USD. </p><p>• 8% of participants were teachers from other local districts. </p><p>• 83% of participants indicated that they had been teaching for three or more years. </p><p>• 51% of participants taught multiple subjects. </p><p>• 40% of participants taught science. </p><p>• 9% of participants taught mathematics. </p><p>The CISE team has met several project goals in the first six months of the grant implementation. The team recruited teachers, held a Kick-Off event, completed training for the first cohort of NGSS Super Training, and conducted classroom observation and Lesson Study Cycles. One of the primary focuses of the training was establishing the foundation for the Next Generation Science standards. Participants learned about NGSS, Performance Expectations (PE), Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs), Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs), and Cross-Cutting Concepts (CCCS), and how they compare to the previous set of standards. Teachers then explored how three-dimensional learning better prepares students for college and career readiness. </p><p>NGSS Super Training participants were also offered the opportunity to obtain the Beginner Level Certification in Fabrication Technology which certifies teachers as "basic," "proficient," and "advanced" in the use of fabrication laboratory equipment for curriculum design and delivery. Every participant was successful at meeting the requirements for the Beginner Fabrication Technology Certification. </p><p>Prior to the classroom observations, an NGSS expert met with teachers to agree on the observation focus and review the lesson plan; the NGSS expert reviewed and documented evidence of good teaching practices, and provided formal feedback. During the Lesson Study Cycles, teams of teacher trainees engaged in collaborative planning-teaching-observation of learning, followed by lesson evaluation and refinement. </p><p>Based on a survey administered as a follow-up to the training, participants found the training to be a valuable experience. Each teacher had an opportunity to demonstrate mastery and an ability to integrate the Next Generation Science Standards and the Fabrication Technology into a unit of instruction, which was submitted into a shared Google Drive folder. </p><p>We are excited to report:</p><p>• 100% of those that completed the training stated that they will be able to facilitate at least 1 NGSS Professional Development at their school site, for colleagues, after completing the NGSS Super Training. </p><p>• 63% increase in the number of participants who felt comfortable or very comfortable operating the 3D printer from the first to the final day. </p><p>• 67% increase in the comfort levels for the number of participants who felt comfortable or very comfortable operating the vinyl cutters from the first to the final day. </p><p>• 86% of participants indicated that they would be interested in receiving additional certification if provided the opportunity. </p><p>• 100% of participants indicated that they would recommend this training series to other teachers. </p><p>Overall, those that completed the training acquired the knowledge about NGSS, thus contributing to the national effort as well as our local effort to implement the new standards one school at a time. We are currently in the training evaluation and revision phase of the project and participants for Cohort Two are being recruited for training during the March - May 2019 cycle. </p><p>Recruiting Cohort One was somewhat challenging due to the short timeline for recruitment. However, once the recruitment phase ended, over 90 teachers expressed an interest in participating and 55 were selected and completed the entire training, thus exceeding the target number set for Cohort One by five teachers. Based on the success with the first cohort and their enthusiasm about the training, our team is confident about being able to meet the target number for Cohort Two and will make the necessary adjustments to some parts of the program based on feedback from all involved. </p><p>While we are still a few years away from being able to measure and evaluate the impact on college and community college completion and matriculation rates, we feel confident about the impact our program has had on increasing students' immersion in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. Each of the 55 teachers who completed our program teaches about 150 students each year, impacting over 8,000 students per year. Over five years, these 55 teachers will reach 40,000 students! That means 40,000 more students excited and inspired about STEM and fabrication technology. That's 40,000 more individuals who will contribute to making Los Angeles not just a better place, but the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live by the year 2050! </p></p>
