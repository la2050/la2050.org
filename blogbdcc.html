</p><h2>We believe that a Los Angeles that welcomes refugees and asylees with open arms - in a way that promotes volunteerism and civic participation through the Neighborhood Council system - will be a better, more compassionate, and more engaged place for all Angelenos. </h2><p>
	Welcome, Neighbor by Miry's List is making Los Angeles a more welcoming city for refugees by giving Angelenos opportunities to CONNECT with their resettling refugee neighbors. In partnership with LA2050 and EmpowerLA, Welcome, Neighbor gives Angelenos opportunities to make direct and meaningful connections with resettling newcomers in our city.
</p><p>
	<em>“Now more than ever it is critical that we help our refugee neighbors make a home right here and Miry's List has been instrumental in this work." — Mayor Eric Garcetti, November 2019</em>
</p><p>
	In fiscal year 2019, 30,000 refugees came to America seeking safety from violence and persecution. Southern California was one of the top destinations for resettlement. These resettling individuals and families left behind their extended families, communities, friends, homes, jobs, and possessions. While all refugees come to the US through resettlement agencies, those agencies only work with families for their first 90 days here and are largely understaffed and underfunded, leaving resettling families with many unmet needs.
</p><p>
	At the same time, despite the negative national rhetoric, many Americans want to help resettling refugees – especially here in Los Angeles. To harness the support of the local community, we launched Welcome, Neighbor in 2018, a framework for Angelenos to get involved directly to support their resettling neighbors through their local neighborhood council.
</p><p>
	Since then, over 20,000 Angelenos have engaged directly with Welcome, Neighbor, and we've reached nearly 80,000 more people through in-person events, social media, and promotional partners. Many city officials have expressed their support. This past December, the Los Angeles City Council adopted a resolution declaring LA as a Welcoming City for refugees. Welcome, Neighbor is uniquely positioned to build on this momentum, activate many more Angelenos and make LA the most welcoming city in the nation.</p><p><em><img alt="The 14 piloting neighborhood councils enrolled in Welcome, Neighbor" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aEig1T2wTbKIcZ49TKV_SBlTQHRa054oEtZKcvxsnKqiIPROpVS6BlZQE80QI6B9FjehjimtkGfoDwzJa_XLRQAYKT8hBcrJtvpKZ4vpX8hRFfaipSyUZeWthio-iBivPK4iLTB7"></em></p><p>Pictured: The 14 piloting neighborhood councils enrolled in Welcome, Neighbor.</p><p>

</p><h2>Program Progress</h2><p>
	Since Miry's List won the 2018 LA2050 Activation Challenge, we have enrolled 14 neighborhood councils in Welcome, Neighbor and appointed 24 volunteer Welcoming Liaisons leading their neighborhood's efforts towards resettling refugees. Our neighborhood welcoming resolution, declaring neighborhoods a safe, welcoming place for all, has been adopted by 9 neighborhood councils across the city. More than 10,800 people have made direct in-person connections with resettling Angelenos at 64 Welcome, Neighbor events.
</p><p>
	Welcome, Neighbor engagements provide interactive opportunities for Angelenos to learn about refugee resettlement in our city, how it feels for families and how we can help. Attendees had the opportunities to meet new arrival families directly, often sharing a meal, conversation, family stories, and getting to know one another as neighbors. Miry's List team members and program recipients have presented at 17 neighborhood council meetings, providing board members and stakeholders with information about and actionable steps for helping resettling Angelenos. Around the holidays, some councils chose to have a direct impact in the form of house-warming gifts: In November 2019 and January 2020, 11 neighborhood councils assisted 11 resettling Angeleno families to help them get the things they need for their first home in LA. Our Los Angeles volunteer list grew by 272 people, many of whom heard about our work through their neighborhood councils, family, and friends.
</p><p>

	In a survey of 64 Welcome, Neighbor participants, we found:
</p><ul>
	<li>100% of participants have a greater knowledge the refugee resettlement system in America and how it works.</li>
	<li>100% of participants have a greater understanding of how it feels to resettle as a refugee in America.</li>
	<li>100% of participants have a greater understanding of how to help families resettling as refugees in Los Angeles</li>
	<li>82% of participants responded that they “loved the experience and want more."</li>
</ul><p>
	The community-driven spirit and structure of the Welcome, Neighbor pilot reflect deeply shared Angeleno values of our diverse city of immigrants. In November 2019, in a video at the
	<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5mDeLzpAuH/"> 2019 Miry's List Gratitude Gala</a>, Mayor Eric Garcetti described the work of Miry's List as “another reminder that Los Angeles is indeed a <em>City of Angels</em>. And a city where everyone is welcome and all of us belong."

</p><h2>Coming Next</h2><p>
	We are in the Activation phase of Welcome, Neighbor and are continuing our programming for LA Neighborhood Councils throughout 2020. Here's what Welcome, Neighbor will focus on in 2020:
</p><ul>
	<li>Expanded neighborhood council direct family wishlist matching, providing a streamlined process for councils to lead their stakeholders in helping resettling Angelenos get their new homes set up.</li>
	<li>Targeting 100% council adoption of the Welcome, Neighbor Resolution</li>
	<li>Participation in Welcoming Activations, facilitated by Miry's List</li>
	<li>Exceed our goal of activating 100,000 Angelenos with Welcome, Neighbor</li>
	<li>Data &amp; Reporting: Welcome, Neighbor survey to continue data collection and analysis to establish learnings and findings to understand how we can improve and measure our impact.</li></ul><h2></h2><p>

<p><p><em>This is an update on <a href="https://activation.la2050.org/play/the-brady-center-to-prevent-gun-violence/">the winning proposal</a> from the PLAY category in the 2018 LA2050 challenge.</em><br></p><p>Brady is now 18 months into our Combating Crime Guns Initiative: Los Angeles (CCGI:LA) program, a multi-pronged approach to Los Angeles gun violence prevention that focuses on stemming the flow of guns into the city. The program is centered around the knowledge that <b>90% of crime guns</b> (firearms that are illegally possessed, used in a crime, or suspected to have been used in a crime) are sold by just <b>5% of gun dealers</b>. Through CCGI:LA, we work to target these irresponsible dealers and shift the burden of gun violence from disproportionately impacted communities to the industry that is flooding these communities with guns.</p><p>With the support of the Goldhirsh Foundation, we are fighting to ensure that in 2050, Los Angelenos of all ages will have access to safe homes, safe neighborhoods, and safe places to play. Under LA2050's <a href="/goals/play.html">'PLAY' goal</a>, our program will impact two metrics: per capita crime rate and perceived safety. </p><p><b><u>Program Updates</u></b></p><p>Over the past months, we've continued to build out our presence and impact in Los Angeles, and we are so excited to share our progress with the LA2050 community. </p><p><u>CalVIP</u></p><p>One of the most significant recent developments is the establishment of the California Violence Intervention and Prevention (CalVIP) Grant Program, which appropriated $30 million in funding for competitive awards to cities and community-based organizations to support evidence-based violence reduction initiatives--a marked $21 million increase from last year's violence reduction funding. This decision is a huge win for the gun violence prevention movement and sets an example for other states to follow about the importance of funding violence reduction initiatives. </p><p>Brady had a substantial role in the passage of this budget legislation. In fact, our Los Angeles Program Manager, Steve Lindley, was selected to be a member of the CalVIP Executive Steering Committee--the party that develops the grant program's Requests for Proposals and makes funding recommendations to the Board. We are honored and excited to be a part of this life-saving grant program. </p><p><u>Prioritizing Gun Dealer Inspections </u></p><p>Brady also recently created a tool to improve the efficiency and efficacy of gun dealer inspections. When conducted regularly and effectively, dealer inspections are a proven way to flag dangerous crime gun dealers and promote responsible business practices. However, due to insufficient resources, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) <b>only inspects roughly 8% of licensed firearm dealers every year.<i> </i></b>Further, the ATF cited 75% of inspected FFLs for violations in 2016, yet only revoked the licenses of less than 1% of cited dealers<i>. The key takeaway: the federal government is unable or unwilling to conduct meaningful oversight on the country gun dealers.<b> </b></i></p><p>One solution to this lack of federal oversight is conducting independent inspections. Many states and municipalities have the authority to conduct inspections independent of the ATF.<b> </b>Using data on thousands of pages of ATF inspection reports, Brady--with the pro bono assistance of a blue chip consulting firm--has analyzed the characteristics of gun dealers that most highly correlate with the irresponsible business practices contributing to urban gun violence and<b> </b>developed a predictive tool that can be used by local authorities to target gun dealer inspections<i>. </i> We look forward to incorporating this tool into our current Los Angeles gun violence prevention strategies.</p><p><u>Louder Than Guns</u></p><p>Brady remains deeply involved with the <a href="https://www.louderthanguns.org/">Louder Than Guns</a> campaign, a project led by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti's Youth Leadership Council to End Gun Violence. Louder Than Guns is a rallying cry for all Angelenos, with the goal of inspiring local activism and ensuring that citizens know the impact that their individual actions can have on reducing gun violence. The campaign has relied on extensive involvement and consulting from Brady's Los Angeles Program Manager and has been extremely impactful since its launch, provoking important discussions regarding the plague of firearm violence in Los Angeles and across the nation.</p><p>The Mayor's Office has requested Brady's support and guidance in bringing the campaign to the national level. We are currently working with the L.A. Mayor's Office, the Mayor's Youth Leadership Council to End Gun Violence, and ad agency Omelet to build off of our success in Los Angeles and launch the campaign to other cities disproportionately impacted by firearm violence. </p><p><b><u>Challenges </u></b></p><p>The lack of oversight and transparency around gun industry policies and practices are an ongoing hindrance to this work. Although Brady works diligently to address these issues on the legislative side, we know that this approach takes time. Acknowledging this, Brady's Combating Crime Guns Initiative largely focuses on more immediate goals, such as raising public awareness of the role of the gun industry in gun violence and finding innovative ways to identify and reform irresponsible gun dealers in the absence of government oversight (such as our gun dealer inspection tool). </p><p><b><u>What's to Come</u></b></p><p>In the coming months, we look forward to leveraging local partnerships to execute multiple collaborative gun violence prevention projects. </p><p>Upcoming plans include:</p><ul><li>Partnering with the Los Angeles Unified School District to distribute firearm safety information to thousands of students and their parents. </li><li>Continuing to build out our work with the LA Mayor's office Youth Council to End Gun Violence. Activities include:<ul><li>Working closely with Brady's youth-led gun violence prevention program, Team Enough as well as the Youth Council to coordinate a youth advocacy and lobbying education training in Sacramento. We believe this partnership will lead to the activation of diverse youth presence in the gun violence prevention movement throughout California. </li></ul><ul><li>Assisting in the development of a national iteration of the Louder Than Guns campaign. </li></ul></li><li>Leveraging our partnerships with the Los Angeles Police Department to begin building our gun dealer inspection tool into existing local independent gun dealer inspection protocols.</li></ul><p>We are so grateful for the support of the Goldhirsh Foundation. Together, we are making Los Angeles a safer place to live, learn, and play.</p></p>

	<em>This is an update on <a href="https://activation.la2050.org/play/the-brady-center-to-prevent-gun-violence/">the winning proposal</a> from the PLAY category in the 2018 LA2050 challenge.</em><br>
	
</p><p>
	California State University Dominguez Hills-LA2050 Project: NGSS &amp; Fab Tech Training
</p><p>
	Report on activities between January 2019 and December 2019<br>
</p><p>
	As part of the LA2050 Activation Challenge, the Center for Innovation in STEM Education (CISE) at CSU Dominguez Hills proposed to empower teachers and provide dynamic training and mentoring on the state adopted, industry-recognized Next Generation Science Standards. We proposed training two cohorts of 50 teachers (100 total) over two years, however, we have been able to sustain the project and are currently training the third cohort of teachers.
</p><p>
	We are pleased to report that the third cohort of 16 teachers is due to complete the training on January 9, 2020, thus exceeding our target number of teachers per cohort and 100 teachers overall. Following is a snapshot of the teachers served, based on participants that completed a post-training survey:
</p><p>
	74% of participants were teachers from LAUSD.
</p><p>
	8% of participants were teachers from Compton USD.
</p><p>
	12% of participants were teachers from Inglewood USD.
</p><p>
	5% of participants were teachers from Lynwood USD.
</p><p>
	87.5% of participants indicated that they had been teaching for three or more years.
</p><p>
	70% of the participants taught multiple subjects.
</p><p>
	25% of the participants taught science.
</p><p>
	1.75% of the participants taught Special Education classes.
</p><p>
	1.8% of participants taught STEM/Computer Science.
</p><p>
	<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Cb3XINQilloHJQZn_gJWA3oQ0VB7GaIhgTXb2SCm3Rv63WXjuTS2DvDJmcWIdmEZttGceHr-fQ2LvAfcb_SqASJNmkMWZ_CXrhLETIUX3wtNmCC7KYqVsdYhAuZJqzfAsUJl9Rmm">
</p><p>
	The CISE team has met all project goals through the grant implementation and is continuing to train a third cohort of teachers, offering them the opportunity to become NGSS experts and obtain a certification in Fabrication Technology. The team recruited teachers, held Kick-Off events, completed the first and second cohort of NGSS Super Training, and conducted classroom observations and Lesson Study Cycles. One of the primary focuses of the training was establishing the foundation for the Next Generation Science Standards. Participants continue to learn about the organization of NGSS, identifying what Performance Expectations (PE), Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs), Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs), and Cross-Cutting Concepts (CCCS) are, and how they compare to the previous set of standards. The training empowers teachers to explore how teaching with an emphasis on DCIs, SEPs, and CCCs, referred to as 3-Dimensional learning, better prepares students for college and career readiness.
</p><p>
	All NGSS Super Training participants are offered the opportunity to obtain the Beginner Level Certification in Fabrication Technology which certifies teachers as basic, proficient, and advanced in the use of fabrication laboratory equipment for curriculum design and delivery. Every participant in cohorts one and two was successful at meeting the requirements for the Beginner Fabrication Technology Certification. Participants in cohort three will complete their certification on January 9, 2020.
</p><p>
	Prior to the classroom observation, teachers met with an NGSS expert to agree on the observation focus and review the lesson plan; the NGSS expert reviewed and documented evidence of good teaching practices and provides formal feedback. During the Lesson Study Cycles, teams of teacher trainees engaged in collaborative planning-teaching-observation of learning, followed by lesson evaluation and refinement in preparation for a second cycle of classroom observations.
</p><p>
	Based on the data collected throughout the training, participants found the training to be a valuable experience. Each teacher had an opportunity to demonstrate mastery and an ability to integrate the Next Generation Science Standards and the Fabrication Technology into a unit of instruction which was submitted into a shared google drive folder, for free accessibility. We are excited to report:
</p><p>
	● Perfect attendance for each day of the training: 100% of participants attended every session.
</p><p>
	● 100% of participants were very satisfied or satisfied with all the workshop sessions.
</p><p>
	● 100% of cohort one and two participants indicated that they would recommend this training series to other teachers.
</p><p>
	● 88% of cohort one and two participants indicated that they would be interested in receiving an additional certification if provided the opportunity.
</p><p>
	Survey data indicates an overwhelming positive response to the NGSS Training offered this year.
</p><p>
	Below are some sample participant comments:
</p><p>
	● Great idea to look at the aquarium webcam through the lens of different CCC. It really pushed me to think beyond what I normally consider.
</p><p>
	● Wonderful presenters! They were well prepared and very helpful!
</p><p>
	● I look forward to using the lesson study model to further my practice.
</p><p>
	● The instructors are very knowledgeable and passionate about making science accessible to children in underserved communities.
</p><p>
	● I finally have a better understanding of NGSS and the 3 dimensions.
</p><p>
	Overall, program completers acquired the required knowledge about NGSS, thus contributing to the national effort as well as our local effort to implement the new standards one school at a time. Over 20 teachers expressed an interest in participating in Cohort 3 and 16 were selected and are in the process of completing the entire training, thus exceeding the target number by 28 teachers.
</p><p>
	While we are still a few years away from being able to measure and evaluate the impact on college and community college completion and matriculation rates, we feel confident about the impact our program has had on increasing students' immersion in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math content. In context, 83 of the elementary teachers who completed our program teach about 30 students each year and the 56 middle/high school teachers teach about 150 students each year, hence impacting over 10,890 students in one year who will benefit from their teachers' new knowledge and enthusiasm. Over five years, these 139 teachers will reach 54,450 students! That means 54,450 more students excited and inspired about STEM and fabrication technology.
</p><p>
	That's 54,450 more individuals who will contribute to making Los Angeles not just a better place, but the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live by the year 2050!

<p><h3>Beyond Legalization: The Implementation Phase of the LA Street Vendor Campaign</h3><p>
	<em>This is an update on the winning proposal from the CREATE category in the 2018 activation challenge. </em><a href="https://activation.la2050.org/create/east-la-community-corporation-elacc/"><em>See the original proposal here</em></a><em>.</em>

</p><p>
	Since we received the LA2050 grant in August 2018, the
	<a href="http://www.streetvendorsforla.org/"> Los Angeles Street Vendor Campaign</a> reached a major milestone: Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously in November 2018 to adopt a permit system for sidewalk vending, finally leading to the legalization of sidewalk vending within the City of LA!
</p><p>
	The impact of this legislation is enormous. More than 50,000 street vendors operate in the City of Los Angeles alone, representing a $504 million industry. With legalization, we can expect to see these numbers grow as street vending becomes a safer way to make a living — especially for women and people of color.
</p><p>
	For the campaign's core partners,
	<a href="http://elacc.org/"> East LA Community Corporation</a>,<a href="http://lurnetwork.org/"> Leadership for Urban Renewal Network</a> (LURN),<a href="https://www.goodfoodla.org/"> Los Angeles Food Policy Council</a> (LAFPC), and<a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/"> Public Counsel</a>, the Los Angeles Street Vendor Campaign has always been about both protecting the rights and dignity of some of the most vulnerable workers in the city, and providing them with greater economic opportunity. Approximately 80 percent of street vendors are women of color who contribute to the rich, diverse street food landscape through the informal economy — and when allowed to do their work legally and safely — contribute to the vitality of their neighborhoods and LA as a whole.
</p><p>
	Take a look at
	<a href="https://www.kcet.org/shows/city-rising/making-it-official-how-la-street-vending-became-legal"> this piece by KCET</a> that covers the most recent history of our campaign and shares stories of vendors across the city.
</p><p>
	The ordinance passed by City Hall will allow street vendors to do just that, and comes after nearly a decade of advocacy from thousands of street vendors and their supporters. But there's still much work to be done. Throughout 2019, we've focused our organizing efforts on three major components: ensuring the City of Los Angeles permit regulations are fair and inclusive; doing outreach to vendors across the region to make sure they know their rights under SB946, the Safe Sidewalk Vending Act; and, building the capacity of vendors by hosting workshops on healthy food and financial resources to make sure they are ready for the implementation of a permit program in 2020.

</p><p>
	<strong>What's next? Summits, workshops, and success</strong>
</p><p>
	On Friday, March 22, 2019 hundreds of local street vendors filled the cafeteria and classrooms of Los Angeles Trade Technical College. This was the First Street Vendor Summit hosted since we won legalization. It provided vendors from across LA County with several workshops on how to become a successful vendor under the new rules and regulations passed by the City. There were four major topics covered by the workshops:
</p><ul>
	<li>The nitty gritty of the new Sidewalk Rules and Regulations in the City of Los Angeles from the Bureau of Street Services, helping vendors understand where they can set up, how much space they can use, if they need a permit yet, and more.</li>
	<li>How to comply with food safety regulations of the Department of Public Health, who regulates food vending throughout the County of Los Angeles;</li>
	<li>What resources are available to vendors who are looking to build their businesses or buy permitted equipment;</li>
	<li>And most importantly, a Know Your Rights workshop that gave details to vendors on what their rights are under SB 946, and how they can appropriately respond to harassment from many different parties.</li>
</ul><p>
	After the summit, we began a series of five capacity-building workshops. We held three workshops on healthy food menus, health equity and food justice, and two on financial planning so that vendors can plan for new carts and permits. Through this, we were able to provide information and resources to 120 vendors. In this implementation phase, we are learning so much more about the people we have been advocating for; and they are teaching us more intimately their needs, empowering us to ensure their livelihoods are always at the forefront of policy, advocacy, and capacity building. We will host another series of workshops and clinics in late summer and early fall that will support vendors with the basics of operating a legitimate business, including obtaining seller's permits and food handling licenses.
</p><p>
	<strong>What we learned</strong>
</p><p>
	This summit and workshops were not only a learning experience for the vendors, but also one for us. It reignited some of our longstanding concerns and highlighted that it will take all of us - vendors, consumers, advocates, and allies - to make sure that vendors are properly and responsibly brought into the formal economy. We put these lessons into a
	<a href="https://lurnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vendor-Summit-Summary-Sheet-March-22-2019pdf.pdf"> summary sheet</a> to get the word out about our concerns and our hopes for the future. These concerns also guided conversations at the coalition meeting on July 18, where 25 organizations re-committed to engage during this phase of the campaign by working on issues related to park vending, cart innovation, outreach, and continued policy advocacy. The coalition will continue to organize and work with vendors to develop vendor based solutions to these concerns, and we will continue to engage public agencies to work on improving the legal vending program.
</p><p>
	<strong>Digital advocacy</strong>
</p><p>
	To uplift the work that vendors and allies have done to legalize street vending, we launched a digital advocacy campaign this month to spread awareness of street vending by sharing stories of “Vendors in Action." Through highlighting why they vend and celebrating their contributions to the fabric of our city, we hope to showcase how vendors are both entrepreneurs and leaders in their communities. This will activate people who are both familiar and unfamiliar with street vendors in LA. This campaign will be using a fixed set of hashtags in both Spanish and English to reach as many people as possible, and ideally create a social media movement to demystify street vending and further normalize their entrepreneurship and leadership in our city.
</p><p>
	We will continue to define and measure our success through the number of new micro-enterprise jobs that are created as a result of legalization, and the number of existing vendors that are trained to manage their businesses, and eventually, navigate the new permit process. We will also continue to tell the story of the LA Street Vendor Movement, and track our progress through engagement on social media. We will continue the digital advocacy campaign through June, and then have another push in August to showcase new work on rules and regulations.
</p><p>
	We're thrilled to be sharing this critical moment in the campaign with everyone involved in the LA2050 Activation Challenge. This grant allows us to activate Angelenos to engage in and build an inclusive economy that supports tens of thousands of workers, whose entrepreneurship often shapes our neighborhood economies and cultural landscape.

<p><p><strong></strong><strong>Communities taking action to stop “bad apple" gun dealers</strong></p><p><em>This is an update on the winning proposal from the PLAY category in the 2018 activation challenge. </em><a href="https://activation.la2050.org/play/the-brady-center-to-prevent-gun-violence/"><em>See the original proposal here.</em></a> </p><p>Brady is proud to continue to report on our Combating Crime Guns Initiative: Los Angeles. The Combating Crime Guns Initiative (CCGI) is a multi-pronged strategy to stem the flow of crime guns into cities that are heavily impacted by gun violence. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF), 90% of crime guns (firearms that are illegally possessed, used in a crime, or suspected to have been used in a crime) are sold by just 5% of gun dealers. Through CCGI, we are using a supply side approach to gun violence, identifying and reforming these gun dealers that are flooding cities with crime guns.</p><p>The Brady Center is partnering with the Goldhirsh Foundation's LA2050 initiative to bring CCGI to Los Angeles and help ensure that in 2050, Los Angelenos of all ages will enjoy safe homes, safe neighborhoods, and safe places to play. Under LA2050's<a href="/goals/play.html"> 'Play' goal</a>, our project applies to two metrics: per capita crime rate and perceived safety. Looking at our progress over the past year, we are more confident than ever in CCGI's ability to impact these measures over time.</p><p><strong>Progress so Far</strong></p><p>After the hiring of our Program Manager, Steve Lindley, our work in Los Angeles accelerated significantly. Steve is an experienced community liaison with over 28 years of experience in law enforcement. In the short period of time he's been with us, he's managed to accomplish a tremendous amount of work. As noted in our previous report, in just his first month as Program Manager, he met with the Los Angeles Mayor's Office, the Los Angeles Police Department, and the Los Angeles area Brady Chapters to introduce himself and discuss strategies to reduce gun violence in the Los Angeles area. </p><p>As a result of these meetings, Steve was invited to assist the Mayor's Office in drafting legislation aimed at providing enhanced oversight of California firearms dealers, mandatory reporting and tracing of law enforcement seized crime guns, and enhancing the gun purchasing public's knowledge of California firearm and firearm safe storage laws. Steve was also a primary advisor to the Mayor's Youth Leadership Council in their 2019<a href="http://louderthanguns.org/"> Louder than Guns</a> campaign.</p><p>Steve and Los Angeles area Brady chapter leadership have been instrumental in gaining support and votes for two important Los Angeles city measures. On June 5, 2019, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously voted for the expansion of the city's safe gun storage ordinance to include long-guns. On June 18, 2019, the Los Angeles Unified School District voted to educate parents about proper gun storage and their legal obligation to safely secure firearms. We hope to continue our working relationship with Los Angeles Unified on these issues and incorporate Brady's multimedia safe storage campaign,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/business/media/family-fire-gun-safety.html"> End Family Fire</a>, into school curricula across the district. Steve is also working with local stakeholders to develop and execute a highschool-based gun safety education program that will activate young adults around gun violence prevention and educate them on simple actions that can be taken to reduce the risk of gun violence.</p><p>In late June, Steve testified before the California Senate's Public Safety Committee in support of Assembly Bill 165 (Gabriel), which will increase funding for law enforcement to bolster its use of Gun Violence Restraining Orders, which allow for the temporary removal of a firearm from an individual who is a danger to themselves or others. The bill passed the Senate's Public Safety Committee and we are eager to see it signed by Governor Newsom. Steve is also working on a public education campaign that targets firearms dealers responsible for a disproportionate number of crime guns recovered in Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>Challenges</strong></p><p>Political and legislative restrictions to gun dealer liability continue to be a hurdle. However, with a legal and policy team dedicated to these issues, we are well positioned to handle these challenges. Emerging and upcoming challenges include building out our relationships and coalitions to assist in preventing further gun violence, continuing to identify the sources of crime guns, activating youth movement around gun violence prevention, and adapting our various national gun violence campaigns for implementation on the local scale.</p><p><strong>What's to Come</strong></p><p>In the coming months, we look forward to how our 2019 and 2020 legislative concepts will be implemented at the State level. We are also eager to see how our the Louder Than Guns and the Los Angeles Unified School District's safe firearm campaign impact the City of Los Angeles. We will be working hard to push forward our crime gun dealer public awareness campaign and our youth education program. Finally, we will continue to strengthen our working relationship with the Los Angeles Mayor's Office and other national and local gun violence prevention and youth-focused groups to maximize our impact and reach.</p></p>

The team recruited teachers, held a Kick Off events, completed the first and second cohort of NGSS Super Training, and conducted classroom observations and Lesson Study Cycles. One of the primary focuses of the training was establishing the foundation for the Next Generation Science standards. Participants learned about the organization of NGSS, identifying what Performance Expectations (PE), Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs), Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs), and Cross-Cutting Concepts (CCCS) are, and how they compare to the previous set of standards. Teachers then explored how teaching with an emphasis on DCIs, SEPs, and CCCs, referred to as 3 Dimensional learning, better prepares students for college and career readiness.</p><p>NGSS Super Training participants were also offered the opportunity to obtain the Beginner Level Certification in Fabrication Technology which certifies teachers as basic, proficient, and advanced in the use of fabrication laboratory equipment for curriculum design and delivery. Every participant was successful at meeting the requirements for the Beginner Fabrication Technology Certification.</p><p>Prior to the classroom observations, an NGSS expert and teachers met in advance to agree on the observation focus and review the lesson plan; the NGSS expert reviewed and documented evidence of good teaching practices, and provided formal feedback. During the Lesson Study Cycles, teams of teacher trainees engaged in collaborative planning-teaching-observation of learning, followed by lesson evaluation and refinement.</p><p><strong>Value delivered to teachers</strong></p><p>Based on the data collected throughout the training, participants found the training to be a valuable experience. Each teacher had an opportunity to demonstrate mastery and an ability to integrate the Next Generation Science Standards and the Fabrication Technology into a unit of instruction which was submitted into a shared google drive folder, for free accessibility. We are excited to report:</p><p>Perfect attendance for each day of the training: 100% of participants attended every session.</p><ul><li>98.2% of participants were very satisfied or satisfied with all workshops.</li><li>100% of participants indicated they would recommend this training series to other teachers.</li><li>88% of participants indicated that they would be interested in receiving additional certification if provided the opportunity.</li><li>72% increase in the comfort level of participants who felt comfortable or very comfortable operating the 3D printer from the first to the final day.</li><li>74%% increase in the comfort level of participants who felt comfortable or very comfortable operating the vinyl cutters from the first to the final day·71% increase in the comfort level of participants that indicated they were either comfortable or very comfortable with teaching how to use a 3D printer.</li><li>69% increase in the comfort level of participants who felt comfortable or very comfortable teaching others to use the vinyl cutters from the first to the final day.</li></ul><p>Overall, program completers acquired the required knowledge about NGSS, thus contributing to the national effort as well as our local effort to implement the new standards one school at a time. Over 80 teachers expressed an interest in participating and 57 were selected and completed the entire training, thus exceeding the target number set for Cohort 2 by 7 teachers.</p><p>While we are still a few years away from being able to measure and evaluate the impact on college and community college completion and matriculation rates, we feel confident about the impact our program has had on increasing students' immersion in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math content. In context, each one of the 57 teachers who completed our program teaches about 150 students each year, hence impacting over 8,550 students in one year who will benefit from their teachers' new knowledge and enthusiasm. Over five years, these 57 teachers will reach 42,750 students! That means 42,750 more students excited and inspired about STEM and fabrication technology. That's 42,750 more individuals who will contribute to making Los Angeles not just a better place, but the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live by the year 2050!</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Saying “yes" to supportive housing for the most vulnerable people</strong></p><p><em>This is an update on the winning proposal from the LIVE category in the 2018 activation challenge. </em><a href="https://activation.la2050.org/live/united-way-of-greater-los-angeles/"><em>See the original proposal here. </em></a></p><p>Since January 2019, the Everyone In campaign has worked tirelessly to site and approve more supportive and affordable housing across L.A. County. With the added capacity we have brought to the housing and homelessness space in messaging, events, and organizing, we have successfully increased the number of units sited per year by 700%. Of the total number of units sited, roughly a third of them are under construction and will open their doors in a few years. The more supportive and affordable units that open, the more people we can bring indoors and chip away at the homelessness crisis. </p><p><strong>Everyone In by the numbers </strong></p><p><em>as of July 31, 2019 </em></p><ul><li>Facebook 39,831 (22%▲)</li><li>Twitter 15,700 (20%▲)</li><li>Instagram 5,117 (42%▲) </li><li>Email 36,139 (31%▲)</li><li>Supportive housing units sited 6,424</li><li>Units under construction 1,812</li></ul><p><strong>The work of the organizing team</strong></p><p>Much of the success of Everyone In can be attributed to the work of our organizing team that cover every region in the county. The organizing team has been actively building community support for over 35 developments countywide. Local residents are getting involved and signing up for trainings to become “super advocates" skilled in the basics of community organizing and messaging. We've empowered residents to build their own local coalitions to address the crisis in their community through hosting events, canvassing, and engaging their elected officials on solutions that work. Our goal this year has been to move the thousands of people who have signed up for Everyone In up the engagement ladder to win local battles. </p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/OjZDT0GZaus">Organizer Series: Meet Quincey</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/irpsx2vwQHY">Organizer Series: Meet Enrique</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/M7gOa_NzFfY">Gather L.A. 2019</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/EynZD-H6jdI">Stories from the Frontline: Long Beach</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/mD6KIyRf5WU">Stories from the Frontline: Pasadena</a></li></ul><p><strong>Engaging residents</strong></p><p>To engage residents, we have relied on our digital outreach and events to cast the widest net to convert new supporters. To celebrate our first anniversary in March, we launched large ads on billboards, buses, and radio spots to build brand awareness. We've increased the number of local events to include The Advocates documentary screenings, a storytelling series called Stories From The Frontline in six communities, and Pop Ups at major community events. We've utilized a texting platform, Hustle, to engage new sign ups to invite them to a local event or have an organizer contact them for follow up. And finally, we've hosted bi-monthly orientations that have 30-40 participants call in during their lunch break on Fridays.</p><p><strong>2019 Campaign Highlights </strong></p><ul><li>Hosted first anniversary event, Gather 2019, at Union Station L.A. with over 500 attendees </li><li>Increased to 13 organizers countywide </li><li>Developed training curriculum to focus on local overview, messaging, organizing tactics and strategy </li><li>Developing policy workshops with Abundant Housing L.A. and Inner City Law Center on preventative measures </li><li>Increase internal staff by 5 employees </li><li>Host bi-monthly call-in orientations to an estimated 30+ people per call</li></ul><p>With the support of the Goldhirsh Foundation, we have expanded our organizing capacity and have new organizers dedicated to areas like Long Beach, Pomona/East San Gabriel Valley, Pasadena/West San Gabriel Valley, Antelope Valley, and East L.A./Gateway Cities. In jurisdictions outside of the City of L.A. we take a deeper look at improving policies that streamline development, provide legal protections for renters, and exploring ways the United Way can enter the rent stabilization conversation. The results of the 2019 Homeless Count showed a 12% increase countywide (16% in the City of L.A.) despite all the work we have done collectively to permanently house and site new development at record rates. Every day last year, we helped 133 homeless people move into permanent housing, but another 150 were driven into homelessness for the first time. </p><p><strong>Partnerships</strong></p><p>We've partnered with Abundant Housing L.A. and Inner City Law Center in developing our policy improvement work in the targeted seven jurisdictions with heavy focus in the City of Whittier, Long Beach, and unincorporated areas. We've worked with L.A. County's Homelessness Initiative and L.A. County Regional Planning Department on the Interim and Supportive Housing Ordinance (ISHO) that would streamline bridge and supportive housing development in unincorporated areas. Unincorporated areas has over 1.1 million residents in 120 communities and, if combined, would be considered the second largest city in the county. Since the unincorporated jurisdictions do not have an elected body, the Board of Supervisors act as their city council and mayor. We just finished community engagement on the ordinance and are waiting for the completion of a feasibility study. We are also looking into strategies to make the Temporary Rent Stabilization Ordinance, an annual cap of 3% rent increase and requiring just cause evictions, permanent in 2020. </p><p><strong>Progress in the last six months</strong><br></p><ul><li>Number of attendees at events: Over 1,800 at 6 storytelling events</li><li>Number of people trained: Over 600 people trained</li><li>Number of policy improvements passed: 5 local laws passed, 1 pending in unincorporated areas</li><li>Number of campaign endorsements: 130 partner organizations and agencies</li></ul></p>
