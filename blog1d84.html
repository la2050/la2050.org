<p><p>Our 2020 My LA2050 Grants Challenge finalists completed their submissions before we had full information about the longer-term trajectory of COVID-19. Today, our communities are hurting in different ways due to the economic impacts of the crisis and it appears that large group events won't resume for a while. With that in mind, we reached out to the finalist organizations and asked them how they will modify their proposals in these circumstances. Read on to see how organizations are pivoting.</p><p>CONNECT</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/creative-acts/">Creative Acts</a> is preparing to bring its Art Attacks program into juvenile camps virtually. The core programming will stay the same: using activities and lessons rooted in the arts to help students find their voice, harness its power, and become civically engaged members of their communities.</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/boyle-heights-beat-radio-pulso/">Boyle Heights Beat / Radio Pulso</a> is continuing with its programming virtually. Mentors continue to meet with students on Zoom calls and students report and conduct interviews online and by phone. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty of the future, the organization will focus its storytelling and reporting to highlight the changing and emerging needs of the community resulting from the pandemic and its economic, mental, and social aftermath. </p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/la-forward/">LA Forward</a> understands that it has never been more important to provide regular Angelenos with resources and tools to advocate for policies that ensure a just and equitable recovery. The organization's LA 101 proposal already relied largely on digital materials and distribution, but the community workshops planned for 2021 will be converted into Zoom meetings, broadening the range of people who can participate and allowing for easy recording and distribution. </p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/ready-to-succeed/">Ready to Succeed</a>'s community-building programming, workshops, and events for RTS Scholars and SFLA youth will now take place via virtual engagement opportunities. Digital programming will allow RTS to directly serve more youth, increasing the number of students served from 90 to 155, and reach even more youth with digital content such as videos.</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/union-station-homeless-services/">Union Station Homeless Services</a>' Community Allies program believes that creating opportunities for authentic human connection is more important than ever in light of COVID-19. The organization has adapted its programming and expanded opportunities for virtual connection through new pilot initiatives such as “Phone Pals," in which new friendships are facilitated over the phone. </p><p>CREATE</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/flintridge-center/">Flintridge Center</a> will adapt and expand its Apprenticeship Preparation Program model to meet emerging community needs and address disparities. Instructors will facilitate the program virtually over 7 weeks; in addition to individualized support, program participants will receive the necessary technology to complete the course, industry-recognized credentials, and weekly stipends. Recognizing that there may be potentially fewer opportunities in union construction because of the pandemic, program scope will expand to support individuals in seeking employment in emerging industries. </p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/grid110/">Grid110</a> has successfully pivoted to an online program model, while still offering the same curriculum, resources, and support for its entrepreneurs. The proposed South LA programs will launch in part or entirely as an online program this summer if necessary, in addition to the organization's events, office hours, and other community-focused efforts.</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/la-sanitation-and-environment-la-industry/">LA Sanitation and Environment</a> is adding an innovative challenge for upcycling enthusiasts to design reusable PPE with textile scrap to its HUB recycling proposal. This would create a win-win situation in both protecting the environment by reducing the amount of waste going to landfills and supporting its frontline workers.</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/las-fotos-project/">Las Fotos Project</a> remains focused on mutual-aid, post-COVID19 support for its students, and women-owned businesses. In the interim, the organization will begin the launch of its project by supporting students and women-owned businesses with safe, at-home product photography services in the upcoming months until the Foto Student can be safely and adequately opened in person.</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/lost-angels-childrens-project/">Lost Angels Children's Project</a> began a campaign for hunger relief in April 2020, providing 2000 meals per week to over 200 families. In the next phase of CA reopening, LACP hopes to bring back its cohort of 10 students who are learning the Industrial Arts through Good Life Mfg., using social distancing and PPE to ensure students stay safe. </p><p>LEARN</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/central-american-resource-center-carecen-of-california/">The Central American Resource Center (CARECEN)</a> is providing support to families experiencing hardships with the following services and programs: the Immigrant Families Fund, food distribution, virtual legal services, and information distribution. CARECEN will be there to ensure that its community recovers and thrives in spite of this crisis.</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/los-angeles-audubon-society-society/">The Los Angeles Audubon Society</a> has increased its organizational capacity by adapting existing programming into online environmental education activities that provide ways for students, teachers, and community members to stay connected to nature and STEAM learning The organization plans to further expand its online learning opportunities in the coming school year, blending guided science and art activities that promote a connection to nature at school, at home, and in local neighborhoods. </p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/southern-california-college-access-network/">Southern California College Access Network</a>'s counseling staff was quick to transition to remote advising. Project SOAR counselors have maintained contact with students through texting, phone conversations, email, and video conferencing. The staff is also in the process of building out a text messaging and artificial intelligence platform that will be integrated into Project SOAR advising practices this summer and into AY 2020-2021. The organization will return to in-person, socially distanced advising on-site once cleared to do so.</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/pediatric-therapy-network/">Pediatric Therapy Network</a> continues to deliver exceptional high-quality early education and therapeutic programming. PTN migrated nearly all of its programs to a telehealth platform, including the Best We Can Be early intervention and parent support programs. In addition, the team developed relevant, digitally accessible resources for families isolated at home that can be accessed for free via its website and YouTube channel. </p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/reading-partners/">Reading Partners</a> is providing bilingual content-rich virtual resources to families, students, and schools via online platforms and text, including biweekly live storytime for students. While all of its school partners have requested the onsite presence of staff during the next school year, the organization will also continue to provide remote, individualized tutoring to students.</p><p>LIVE</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/crop-swap-la/">Crop Swap LA </a>will require its staff to wear masks, gloves, and to evaluate themselves as to whether they are healthy enough to assist in garden installations. Only minimal staff/volunteers are to be present for installations, and interactions with the home residents will remain scarce. The West Adams Farmers Market also continues to run with approval from the city having visited to observe containment tactics.</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/jenesse-center-inc/">Jenesse Center, Inc.</a> has responded swiftly to continue to provide clients with services, switching to virtual formats to connect with clients when possible. During the pandemic, Jenesse is also experiencing an unprecedented number of calls to its crisis hotline. In response, the organization has added phone lines to assist callers, contracted with two local hotels to house survivors, and hired 5 additional Case Managers and one Client Service Specialist.</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/safe-parking-la-a-project-of-community-partners/">Safe Parking LA</a> will activate a series of grassroots volunteer opportunities as planned. In response to the current landscape, Neighbors for Home activities will move forward with some modifications. The organization will work with partners as they are willing and available while shifting its focus to building a stronger community engagement infrastructure and developing a neighborhood volunteer community through networking and digital outreach. </p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/strategic-actions-for-a-just-economy-saje/">Strategic Actions for a Just Economy (SAJE)</a> understands eviction prevention has become an even higher priority as the COVID-19 pandemic. Its easy-to-use and multi-lingual online resources and tools can help tenants effectively document and respond to issues of harassment and slum housing conditions - two major drivers of displacement. </p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/clinica-msr-oscar-a-romero/">Clinica Msr. Oscar A. Romero</a> is on the front lines of the health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, playing a key role in both prevention and diagnosis of the virus. The clinic aims to: purchase equipment to provide primary care and mental health services through telehealth, provide remote health education related to COVID-19 for high-risk groups and educate underserved community members, provide sanitation supplies to homeless patients visiting its site for weekly showers, and facilitate medication delivery for high-risk patients.</p><p>PLAY</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/city-of-los-angeles-department-of-recreation-and-parks/">The City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks</a> is shifting location of its mobile programming to serve LA city parks that are not offering Summer 2020 Youth Programs. Approximately 30 sites will host the vans this summer, with programs focused on outdoor activities that allow for social distancing such as field hockey, tennis, and track and field.</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/los-angeles-dodgers-foundation/">The Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation</a> is currently evaluating the Gonzales Park project completion timeline and at this time, there have been no changes made to the project scope or design. The organization envisions a significant grand opening celebration in spring 2021 honoring Jackie Robinson and uplifting the Compton community.</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/los-angeles-maritime-institute/">Los Angeles Maritime Institute</a>'s Ocean Adventure Together Program launches in July 2020. If outdoor gathering is permitted, LAMI will follow capacity guidelines and, if necessary, reduce the number of participants and increase the number of events and voyages offered. If not, LAMI is prepared to create enjoyable, immersive, and educational virtual adaptations of engagement plans, and suspending in-person activities until it is safe to do so.</p><p><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/public-matters/">Public Matters</a> knows that traffic safety has become more urgent due to the pandemic as people who walk, bike and roll are using streets differently for outdoor recreation. The organization will enhance the project's digital mapping and communication products for community mobilization, education, training, and to promote social cohesion and will also adapt public performances and events for safe distancing.</p><br><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/the-urban-warehouse/">The Urban Warehouse</a> switched its after-school programming to online, virtual programming. For example, the organization is now using an online “Game of Skate" Zoom program, providing one-on-one tutoring online, and holding digital entrepreneurial workshops. The organization has also been responding to increased need in the community during its Food Bank Fridays.</p>

	In this year's My LA2050 Grants Challenge, we received 285 proposals to make LA the best place to LIVE, LEARN, PLAY, CONNECT, and CREATE. We saw so many unique proposals working on every issue imaginable - civic engagement, food systems and sustainability, criminal justice reform, obesity, mental health, diversity in media, film, and television, homelessness, COVID-19 relief, and many more. If you didn't catch our last few blogs, we recapped trends in the proposals from each goal category: <a href="/blog/trends-in-the-live-goal-category.html">LIVE</a>, <a href="/blog/trends-in-the-learn-goal-category.html">LEARN</a>, <a href="/blog/trends-in-the-play-goal-category.html">PLAY</a>, <a href="/blog/trends-in-the-connect-goal-category.html">CONNECT</a>, and <a href="/blog/trends-in-the-create-goal-category.html">CREATE</a>.<br>
</p><p>
	This week, we announced the 25 finalists in the <a href="http://challenge.la2050.org/">My LA2050 Grants Challenge</a>. Each of the finalist proposals will be up for a vote June 8th through June 15th. The results of voting will determine the size of the grant that each organization receives. But before we get to voting, here's some of the data we've gleaned from proposals to this year's grants challenge.
</p><p>
	<strong>Types of Organizations</strong>
</p><p>
	We're thrilled to have received 130+ more proposals than last year's grants challenge. We're grateful to every organization that participated in this year's challenge, especially given the uncertainty in our world. Of the 285 proposals we received in the challenge, 80 percent were from nonprofit organizations. About nine percent of proposals came from for-profit organizations, and another nine percent came from fiscally sponsored groups. We received five proposals from social enterprises or B-corps and three proposals from government entities. 60 percent of applicants had never applied to the grants challenge before.
</p><p>
	<strong>Organization Size</strong>
</p><p>
	A majority of organizations that applied to the grants challenge are on the smaller side in terms of staff with 70 percent of organizations reporting fewer than 20 employees. 43 percent of applicants are even smaller, reporting between zero and five employees. But, when it comes to organizational budgets, there was more of a range with 58 percent of applicants reporting annual operating budgets under $1 million. Of those organizations, 18 percent reported budgets in the range of $100,000 - $500,000. 42 percent of applicants have budgets greater than $1 million.
</p><p>
	<strong>Type of Proposal</strong>
</p><p>
	72 percent of applicants to the challenge sought funding to expand an existing program at their organization. 20 percent of proposals were seeking funding for a pilot program, and six percent were looking to fund the lateral application of a solution to a new issue area. Only one percent of proposals were seeking funding for research projects.
</p><p>
	<strong>Regional Impact</strong>
</p><p>
	We asked all 285 applicants to indicate which communities they would reach with their proposals. Applicants were given the option to select more than one geographic area or to select an overarching region — Los Angeles County, the City of Los Angeles, or the LAUSD. Nearly half of all proposals selected all of Los Angeles County, 38 percent of proposals selected South LA as a focus of their work, 32 percent selected Central LA, and 27 percent selected East LA.

	In this year's My LA2050 Grants Challenge, we received 25 submissions to the PLAY goal category. This goal category depicts a Los Angeles where people of all ages have easy access to clean, safe, and sustainable venues to enjoy the natural environment, arts and cultural resources, local beaches, and waterways. You can see a summary of every single PLAY proposal categorized by issue area <strong><a href="/blog/making-la-the-best-place-to-play.html">here</a></strong>.<br>
</p><p>
	Here are a few trends we noticed in submissions to the PLAY goal category:
</p><ol>
	<li>Proposals to the PLAY goal category tended to focus on <strong>building community and activating neighborhood spaces for play</strong>. Through pop-up events or volunteering, the goals of these proposals were to get people engaged with their communities, create safe, walkable neighborhoods, and increase the number of open space and park facilities. Organizations like the <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/los-angeles-neighborhood-initiative-lani/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/city-of-los-angeles-department-of-recreation-and-parks/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/nature-for-all/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Nature for All</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/ciclavia/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">CicLAvia</a> make us hopeful for a time when we can all gather together again! </li>
	<li><strong>The most commonly targeted metric in the PLAY category was 'youth sports participation.'</strong> This year 13 organizations aimed to improve the physical fitness of young athletes of all abilities through sports like lacrosse, baseball, and skateboarding. In doing so, they also hope to teach participants essential life skills and support their educational progress. These organizations include <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/harlem-lacrosse-los-angeles/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Harlem Lacrosse</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/los-angeles-dodgers-foundation/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Dodgers Foundation</a>, the<a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/the-urban-warehouse/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink"> Urban Warehouse</a>, and others.</li>
	<li>We also saw <strong>a trend in PLAY proposals encouraging Angelenos to get active not just for their physical health, but also for their mental wellness.</strong> Projects from the <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/american-heart-association/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">American Heart Association</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/up2us-inc/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Up2Us, Inc.</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/cedars-sinai-medical-center/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Cedars Sinai Medical Center</a> specifically highlighted how spending time outdoors and engaging in sports and recreation activities can improve the social and emotional health of participants.</li>
	<li>This year, <strong>we received more than double the number of proposals in the PLAY category compared to both 2018 and 2019.</strong> Although PLAY is still the smallest category in this year's challenge with 25 projects, we were excited to see such an increase from the previous two years. </li>

<p><p>
	In this year's My LA2050 Grants Challenge, we received 46 submissions to the CREATE goal category. This goal category depicts a Los Angeles that is thriving creatively with innovation in all sectors, from technology to the arts, spurring inclusive and equitable economic growth. You can see a summary of every single CREATE proposal categorized by issue area <a href="/blog/making-la-the-best-place-to-create.html">here</a>.<br>
</p><p>
	Here are four trends we noticed in submissions to the CREATE goal category:
</p><ol>
	<li>In the CREATE category,<strong> nearly 50 percent of proposals seek to increase the number of minority- and women-owned businesses in Los Angeles.</strong> This was by far the most selected metric, which was also the case in our previous two grants challenges. Los Angeles is an incredibly diverse city, and this sustained trend tells us that Angelenos are focused on having a business ecosystem reflective of that diversity. Our vision for the year 2050 is that 50 percent of businesses will be women-owned, and 50 percent will be minority-owned. Organizations like <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/grid110/">Grid 110</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/smith-co-llc-dba-kolor-society/">Kolor Society</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/la-plaza-de-cultura-y-artes/">LA Plaza Cultura Y Artes</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/refoundry/">Refoundry</a>, and others are trying to make this vision a reality.</li>
	<li><strong>The second most popular metric among submissions to the CREATE category was 'employment in the creative industries.'</strong> The creative industries are a massive part of the Los Angeles economy, so it's no surprise that dozens of proposals are focused on securing career pathways and employment for diverse candidates. <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/truthseekers-inc/">Truthseekers Inc</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/los-angeles-center-of-photography/">the Los Angeles Center of Photography</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/the-alliance-for-media-arts-culture/">the Alliance for Media Arts + Culture</a>, and <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/las-fotos-project/">Las Fotos Project</a> are just a few of the proposals hoping to impact employment in the creative industries.</li>
	<li>In this goal category, <strong>workforce development is by far the most popular tactic for producing change.</strong> Whether it's creating inroads for the tech industry, media and film industries or the science and STEM fields, a majority of the 46 CREATE proposals rely on workforce development as a means of accomplishing their goal. Proposals in this goal category focus on a variety of populations - from formerly incarcerated individuals to foster youth and youth with disabilities - but ultimately share similar tactics. Examples of workforce development proposals include <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/altasea-at-the-port-of-los-angeles/">AltaSea</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/youth-business-alliance/">Youth Business Alliance</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/lost-angels-childrens-project/">Lost Angels Children's Project</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/coop-careers/">COOP Careers</a>, and many more. </li>
	<li><strong>The CREATE category received more proposals from for-profit businesses than any other category.</strong> Many of these businesses recognize and acknowledge that our economy thrives when small businesses are supported and all people have access to opportunities for employment. It's inspiring to see for-profits like <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/smith-co-llc-dba-kolor-society/">Kolor Society</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/startup-coil-llc/">Startup Coil LLC</a>, and <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/codemarket/">Codemarket</a> working towards greater community benefit.</li>

<p><p>The LEARN goal category received the highest number of submissions in this year's My LA2050 Grants Challenge, with 82 proposals focused on advancing educational opportunities from early education through college and setting a foundation for lifelong learning. You can see a summary of every single LEARN proposal categorized by issue area <strong><a href="/blog/making-la-the-best-place-to-learn.html">here</a></strong>.</p><p>Below are five trends we noticed in submissions to the LEARN goal category:</p><ol><li>Nearly fifty percent of proposals in the LEARN category are seeking to positively impact high school graduation rates, especially for high-needs groups. Organizations are finding creative ways to encourage students to succeed in their education by providing support outside of the classroom in the form of wraparound services, peer leadership opportunities, arts programming, and more. Submissions in this area include <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/new-earth/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">New Earth</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/womens-voices-now/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Women's Voices Now</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/united-friends-of-the-children/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">United Friends of the Children</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/ryman-arts/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Ryman Arts</a>.</li><li>Organizations are not just focused on high school completion, but also increasing the number of young people of all backgrounds who continue to attend college. In this category, 45 percent of proposals seek to improve college matriculation rates in Los Angeles County. Tactics include preparation for the SAT and ACT, providing financial assistance for college, and mentorship programs. Some of these proposals came from <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/everydae/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Everydae</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/operation-jump-start/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Operation Jump Start</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/costsbeyondtuition-org/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">CostsBeyondTuition.org</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/college-access-plan/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">College Access Plan</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/collegespring/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">CollegeSpring</a>.</li><li>As in the past My LA2050 Grants Challenges, we're seeing many proposals focus on preparing students for the workforce of the future. Organizations are intent on providing educational opportunities that expose students to a variety of careers and prepare them for a diverse and technologically advanced workplace. <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/the-los-angeles-coalition/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">The Los Angeles Coalition for the Economy &amp; Jobs</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/gladeo/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Gladeo</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/executive-director/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">EnCorps</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/junior-high-incorporated/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Junior High</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/moste-motivating-our-students-through-experience/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">MOSTe</a> are all seeking to make advancements in this area.</li><li>There is a particularly noticeable dearth of proposals focused on 'early education enrollment.' This year, only three out of 82 projects are focused on early education enrollment in this year's challenge, making it the least sought-after metric. The three proposals hoping to impact early education enrollment are from <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/the-literacy-club/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">the Literacy Club</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/pediatric-therapy-network/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Pediatric Therapy Network</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/education-through-music-los-angeles/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Education Through Music</a>.</li><li>Lastly, in response to COVID-19, several organizations are seeking funding to build out digital platforms and opportunities for online learning for home-bound youth, including <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/writegirl-a-project-of-community-partners/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Write Girl</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/heart-of-los-angeles-hola/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Heart of Los Angeles</a>.

<div class='blogpost-shadedbox richtext'>
<p><p>In this year's My LA2050 Grants Challenge, we received 67 submissions to the CONNECT goal category. This goal category depicts a future where every resident in our region is empowered to engage and interact with their fellow Angelenos, move around our city efficiently, and contribute meaningfully to the civic process. You can see a summary of every single CONNECT proposal categorized by issue area <a href="/blog/making-la-the-best-place-to-connect.html">here</a>.<br></p>
<p>Here are four trends we noticed in submissions to the CONNECT goal category:</p>
<ol><li>While COVID-19 means we're safer home, Angelenos are working to stay connected by any means possible, giving this category new meaning. We saw a trend in proposals aspiring to revive our connections to the city and each other post-pandemic. Proposals like <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/inspiring-service/">Inspiring Service</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/insightla/">InsightLA</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/union-rescue-mission/">Union Rescue Mission</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/coalition-for-humane-immigrant-rights-chirla/">CHIRLA</a>, and more give us so much hope for the future of our region! On issues like homelessness and immigrant rights, these organizations want to inspire and encourage people to get active and be part of the solutions to some of LA's most intractable problems.</li><li>Along those lines, 67% of submissions to the CONNECT category were targeting the 'social and emotional support' metric. From <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/citizens-of-culture/">mental health services </a>and <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/trauma-informed-la-tila/">trauma response</a> to <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/social-cipher/">an educational video game for children with autism</a>, there are many creative ways in which organizations are looking to ensure that Angelenos have sufficient support. It's clear to us that people are yearning for deeper social and emotional connection during this period of physical distancing. Among the organizations focused on impacting social and emotional support in Los Angeles are <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/citizens-of-culture/">Citizens of Culture</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/social-cipher/">Social Cipher</a>, the <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/indigenous-circle-of-wellness-sooh-shinálí-sister-project/">Indigenous Circle of Wellness</a>, and more.</li><li>We also noticed a desire to utilize and activate volunteers across all issue areas. Volunteering is one of the most important ways we can engage with our local communities, so it's no surprise that organizations like <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/l-a-works/">LA Works</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/826la/">826LA</a>, and <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/plus-me-project/">PLUS ME Project</a> are hoping to increase 'rates of volunteerism' in the region.</li><li>More than one-third of the CONNECT proposals focused on the transformative power of public art to inspire civic engagement and bring people together. Public music performances from <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/neighborhood-music-school/">the Neighborhood Music School</a>, a puppet festival from <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/skirball-cultural-center/">the Skirball Cultural Center</a>, and a pop-up “dancemobile” from <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/heidi-duckler-dance/">Heidi Duckler Dance</a> are just a few of the creative arts-based events that groups are looking forward to once we can all gather again. </li></ol></p>
