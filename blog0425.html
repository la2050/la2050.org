<p><p><em>This is an update on <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2019/connect/casa-of-los-angeles/">the winning proposal</a> from the CONNECT category in the 2019 LA2050 challenge.</em><br></p><p>
	CASA of Los Angeles' mission is to mobilize community volunteers to advocate for children in the Los Angeles County child welfare system who have experienced abuse and neglect. CASA/LA has long recognized the social, racial, and economic disparities within the child welfare system, and has worked to not only serve more children in care in order to ameliorate the consequences of those disparities but to prepare our community volunteers to support the establishment of more equitable opportunities for children and youth within the child welfare system and in life.
</p><p>
	<span></span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/exXvcalc3T9ZsOKkm2iNcOool5LsJNelg4mfggpAG8ARIg08y5PV4tnZpgKgQoxx_KGIH45U5oiwAyKBt3Gk2Ud0kc4T9PbqrDyH2BIMN1GnYFHUCrCtXiLrBraFGRx516E48gfP"><br>
</p><p>
	According to a 2018 study conducted by USC's Child Data Network, four out of five LA probation youth have received at least one child welfare referral for suspected maltreatment, with many experiencing their first referral early in childhood. These youth are frequently called crossover youth as they have pending cases in both the dependency care system (foster care) and juvenile delinquency. They also have higher rates of unemployment, adult incarceration, and homelessness. Los Angeles County's Youth Diversion and Development Office is implementing a comprehensive youth diversion model to link youth facing entry into the juvenile justice system with community-based organizations that support their development, in lieu of an arrest or citation. Unfortunately, youth in foster care are not able to participate in this program unless a parent or guardian can monitor their participation.
</p><p>
	CASA is working to fill this gap by training and appointing LA community members as advocates for these youth so they may participate in diversion programs. These volunteers will supervise and monitor youth's participation in such programs by advocating for access to services, supporting youth in navigating challenges with community based organizations (requests to change provider, address conflicts, etc.), addressing barriers to successful completion of the diversion plan (e.g., transportation), monitoring progress within the program, and coordinating between various parties on youth's team. Through LA2050, CASA/LA is working to recruit and train 400 volunteers to serve youth in the foster care system, of which a chosen cohort will help to pilot this important program.
</p><p>
	<b>Building Collaborations with Key Partners</b>
</p><p>
	Since this fall, CASA of Los Angeles has been working diligently with the Youth Development and Diversion Office (YDD) and the Children's Law Center (CLC) to determine the best protocols by which to appoint and serve youth in diversion programs. The three partners have a meeting scheduled in February in order to finalize those details and begin the referral process. Additionally, from that meeting, CASA of Los Angeles hopes to begin presenting to the Community Based Organizations responsible for the diversion programs so they will better understand the CASA's role in overseeing youth participation.
</p><p>
	In addition, CASA of Los Angeles has met with personnel in probation, in the Public Defender's office and alternate public defender's office to discuss our involvement in diversion and how we are branching into juvenile justice. Through this relationship building, we are creating stronger connections into the juvenile justice system so we may better advocate for youth who are dually involved in both systems.
</p><p>
	<b>Piloting the Program</b>
</p><p>
	CASA of Los Angeles has already identified a small group of CASA volunteers to be part of the pilot program. Once the manual in overseeing diversion cases is finalized, this cohort will participate in the initiative training and begin to oversee the first set of appointed cases. In addition to serving the youth in question, the pilot cohort will also provide feedback and input on the training and program management. Currently, we have eight CASA volunteers interested in this program, which will allow us to serve the first cases assigned in the system.
</p><p>
	<b>More to Come</b>
</p><p>
	By the beginning of March, we intend to train our first cohort and anticipate serving the first 10 cases by April 1, in collaboration with YDD, CLC and the CBOs. By the summer, CASA intends to launch its first official cohort of volunteers, who will be trained to oversee youth participation in the diversion program. Over the next year, CASA/LA hopes to scale this program to recruit more volunteers from outside of CASA's volunteer pool, offering community members another volunteer opportunity within the CASA model.
</p><p>
	For CASA of Los Angeles, this program is the beginning of our volunteers becoming more involved in the juvenile justice system, working with youth who are at risk of being dually involved in the dependency and delinquency systems. Through this program, we hope to one day serve more crossover youth to help ensure they receive the services and supports they need to avoid ongoing participation in the justice system and grow up to lead healthy, free and resilient lives.

	<em>This is an update on the winning proposal from the CONNECT category in the 2019 LA2050 challenge.</em>
</p><p>
	Since we received the LA2050 grant in the summer of 2019, we've been hard at work developing and building resources, collaborating with key stakeholders, outreaching and promoting opportunities to empower LA youth to be engaged in the civic process.
</p><p>
	Rock the Vote is dedicated to building a new generation of Los Angeles civic leaders and volunteers through 1) Democracy Class, a fun, interactive high school curriculum about pre-registering, voting, participating in the census, and getting involved in or running for a seat on a Los Angeles Neighborhood Council, and 2) Create-A-Thons with local artists and activists to develop compelling messages and original content about voting and the census that will be shared nationwide through social media.
</p><p>
	<em><b>Progress so far</b></em>
</p><p>
	After conversations with LAUSD and learning of the CA's Secretary of State Office's plans to push back their high school civic engagement efforts, which typically happen in September and April to January/February, we collectively decided to pivot the push for educators to teach Democracy Class from Fall 2019 to early 2020. The new timeline has allowed us more time to conduct outreach, organize plans with LAUSD, develop incentives for educators, and more. Early 2020 was chosen because it allows educators to build on the natural momentums around the new California primary date of March 3rd and the nearing of the 2020 Census in April.
</p><p>
	Instead, our fall activation centered around LA County's Mock Elections in late September, which provided voters with the opportunity to explore the new voter experience through its <em>Voting for All People</em>. We worked with the LA County registrar's office to approve students under 18 to participate in the mock election and promoted the mock election to our LA list and on our social media.
</p><p>
	As part of our LA2050 grant we developed an interactive Census curriculum that has been reviewed by The Census Innovation Lab and civic education experts. The lesson plan is specifically designed for high school age individuals in hard-to-count communities. The curriculum features a <a href="https://youtu.be/HMaaH6Suf98">short explainer video</a> and is interactive, hands-on, answers common questions around the 2020 census. The curriculum can be accessed by signing up for
</p><p>
	Thanks to the LA2050 grantee luncheon in the fall, we connected with the City of LA's Department of Neighborhood Empowerment to identify what resources already existed for educating and raising awareness about the city's Neighborhood Councils. We are reviewing these resources and using them to inform the kits we develop for LA teachers to teach about Los Angeles Neighborhood Council Elections.
</p><p>
	We built a Democracy Class website specifically designed for our LA efforts to have core curriculum and census curriculum taught in over 90 public high schools and in community centers and after school programs throughout the city. What is Democracy Class, you ask? Democracy Class is a free, nonpartisan curriculum that educates young people about the importance and history of voting and pre-registers and registers them to vote.
</p><p>
	Those who sign up will have access to lesson plans featuring:
</p><ul>
	<li>The history and importance of voting</li>
	<li>Modern-day voting rights</li>
	<li>The importance of local elections</li>
	<li>How voting can impact issues in communities</li>
	<li>The importance of the 2020 Census</li>
</ul><p>
	<a href="https://www.rockthevote.org/resources/democracy-class/LA/">Educators or anyone interested can learn more here.</a> Or if you'd like to partner with us reach out to <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#452120282a263724263c05372a262e312d20332a31206b2a3722"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4c282921232f3e2d2f352f202d3f3f0c3e232f273824293a23382962233e2b">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
</p><p>
	Through our collaborations with the Census Innovation Lab we also developed and soft-launched Creatives for the Count <a href="https://creativesforthecount.org/">website</a>. The site is a place for creators to submit content to be used by organizations and individuals to share on social media at any time to help us get more LA residents to complete the Census. The website will be home to creative content developed at our LA Create-A-Thon in March, which we will host as part of our LA2050 grant. The Create-A-Thon will be an opportunity for members of the community to join us in creating fun and engaging social media content that can be used to promote why the census is important for every single one of us to complete this April.
</p><p>
	<em><b>What's next for us in completing our LA2050 grant goals?</b></em>
</p><p>
	It's crunch time to get Democracy Class into schools. We'll begin outreach to educators in the coming week, and continue recruiting LA partners and influential voices to help us spread the word.
</p><p>
	We're in the process of developing the Neighborhood Council kit to help individuals understand how to run for local office.
</p><p>
	And as part of the census awareness efforts in LA we finally have our Create-A-Thon coming up in March. We're in the midst of planning for that now, and we will have more announcements in the coming weeks on how you can attend.
