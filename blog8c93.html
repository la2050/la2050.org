<p><p>LA2050 has a new resource for anyone looking for ways to do good in Los Angeles. The <a href="https://archive.la2050.org/">My LA2050 Ideas Archive</a> launched its beta version October 2018 with a searchable website of organizations, projects, and ideas submitted through the past five years of the My LA2050 Challenge.</p>
<p>Since 2013, the My LA2050 Grants Challenge has distributed $5.3 million in grants by asking, “How can we make Los Angeles the best place to live, learn, create, play, and connect?” For each challenge, hundreds of non-profit organizations, government agencies, and private sector firms have answered with innovative ideas.</p>
<p>The website is a collection of information about the organizations, their projects, and in some cases, videos that highlight their work. Users can search by keyword, by issue area, or by goal category.</p>
<p>Searches reveal a list of matching organizations (non-profit, for-profit, and government). On each organization page, users can see pictures, connect with organizations through social media, and find links to get involved. Each page also includes every proposal submitted by the organization to My LA2050 Challenges throughout the years.</p>
<p>We've learned so much about the good work going on in our county that we wanted to share all of these organizations and projects with the public. We hope people will use it to find volunteer opportunities, potential partnerships, and causes they care about. </p></p>

<p><p>
	Through the My LA2050 Grants Challenges, we have gotten to be a part of some truly amazing work here in LA. Over the past few months, we've taken the time to highlight some of this work and some of the winners in our newsletter. Our grantees shared some of their highs and lows since their big My LA2050 wins, and they were just too good not to share twice.
</p><p>
	<br>
</p><p>
	<strong>CicLAvia</strong>, 2013 Winner</p><p>CicLAvia closes streets to cars for a day, and opens them to the community to gather together and bike, skateboard, run, dance, or simply wander. Their latest event on September 30th, 
	<em>Celebrate LA!: LA Phil 100 x CicLAvia</em>, marked the 27th CicLAvia since 2010. In that time, more than 1.6 million people have participated in CicLAvia, which has covered more than 180 miles of LA's streets. CicLAvia is fueling a transformation across the region by inspiring more people to reimagine urban life without a car, and improving personal health and quality of life. <em>More than 50 percent of participants in a recent survey said that they would be inactive if not for CicLAvia</em>. On event days, local air quality improves by 50 percent and Metro ridership increases by 30 percent. As a result, the region has become increasingly connected by public transportation, bike lanes, and pedestrian centers.</p><p>
	<strong><br>
	</strong>
</p><p>
	<strong>
	MoveLA</strong>, 2014 Winner</p><p>After winning the 2014 My LA2050 Grants Challenge, Move LA was instrumental in the passing of Measure M. (If you don't know, Measure M provides $140 billion over 40 years to build out LA County's transit system.) The My LA2050 grant helped build Move LA's social media and communications capacity, which was integral to the Measure M victory. Now, Move LA is gearing up to electrify the Metrolink commuter rail system, which serves four major counties in SoCal. Move LA is also working to modernize its goods movement system so as to #dumpdiesel and conquer climate change, while collaborating with the South Coast Air Quality Management District to accelerate the deployment of clean cars and trucks in SoCal. Follow @MoveLA on Twitter and Instagram to stay updated and get involved!<br></p><p>
	<br>
	<strong>Homeboy Industries</strong>, 2013 Winner and 2018 Honorable Mention </p><p>This year, 
	Homeboy Industries is celebrating 30 years of serving the city through radical kinship and by breaking intergenerational cycles of poverty and violence. From the beginning, Homeboy Industries dared to discard the prevailing “tough on crime" approach to be “smart on crime“ - that is, investing in the humanity of healing. Winning the My LA2050 grant in 2013 has allowed Homeboy to serve approximately 8,000 individuals each year, including employing at least 250 previously incarcerated and formerly gang-involved men and women annually in their core paid re-entry program. Last year Homeboy provided more than 700 GED tutoring sessions and 11,800 tattoo removal treatments, saw 76 solar panel program graduates and 118 records expunged, and announced the grand opening of Homeboy Electronics Recycling! (S/o to entrepreneur Kabira Stokes!)</p><p>
	<br>
</p><p>
	<strong>LA Bioscience Hub</strong>, 2015 Winner</p><p>
	LA Bioscience Hub just graduated its third cohort of Biotech Leaders Academy students. Biotech Leaders Academy fosters future generations of diverse bioscience entrepreneurs for Los Angeles through its two key components: 1) providing community college students in LA's Eastside with entrepreneurship training; and 2) connecting them to paid industry internships. Almost all program participants are students of color, most of whom are first-generation college students.
</p><p>
	Now, LA Bioscience Hub is expanding its programming to work more closely with biotech start-ups, helping them grow in LA and create more opportunities for students from LA community colleges to gain hands-on experience and access new employment opportunities. This October, LA Bioscience Hub brought start-ups together for a workshop to develop their internal capacity for hosting student interns. To learn more or to get involved, head to their 
	website.
</p><p>
	<br>
</p><p>
	<strong>826LA</strong>, 2013 Winner
</p><p>
	During the 2016-2017 school year, 
	826LA helped 9,263 students improve their creative and expository writing skills, showcasing their work in publications like 
	<em>When the Moon is Up</em> and numerous chapbooks. Volunteers donated more than 22,000 hours of their time to make it happen. This summer, students in the Write On! summer camp spent four weeks exploring themes such as Arts and Culture, Nature, STEAM, and Visiting the Future. In the process, they learned to express themselves and describe the world in which they live. As one student wrote, “Not everyone is blinded by the beauty of our city. I won't say it's my cup of Starbucks, but it's the still image I call my life."
</p><p>
	<br>
</p><p>
	<strong>City Year LA</strong>, 2014 Winner</p><p>
	This year, 
	City Year Los Angeles embarked on its second decade of service to the students of Watts, South L.A., Boyle Heights, Pico Union, and Westlake. Over the last 11 years, City Year Los Angeles has called on nearly 2,800 diverse AmeriCorps members to help thousands of students stay in school and on track to graduate, college and career ready. City Year AmeriCorps members work side-by-side with teachers and develop transformational relationships with students to help them succeed.
</p><p>
	Since winning the My LA2050 Grants Challenge in 2014, City Year Los Angeles has deployed 1,140 AmeriCorps members to serve nearly 2 million hours as full-time tutors, mentors, and role models in Los Angeles Unified schools. City Year Los Angeles graduates continue to strengthen the city's workforce by entering various fields including social work, medicine, education, and non-profit work.
</p><p>
	<br>
</p><p>
	<strong>AltaSea</strong>, 2016 Winner
	<br>
</p><p>
	AltaSea is transforming 35 acres in the oldest part of the Los Angeles harbor into a center for ocean-focused research, STEM education, and sustainable business incubation. Their LA2050 grant helped form the L.A. Waterfront STEM Network, which provides ocean-focused education to middle school students, inspiring them to champion sustainable uses of our oceans.
</p><p>
	Alta Sea has had an eventful year:
</p><ul>
	<li>Hosting the crew of "The Swim" as they prepared for Ben Lecomte's audacious attempt to swim 5,500 miles across the Pacific Ocean. Ben's swim from Tokyo to San Francisco through the Great Garbage Patch of the North Pacific is designed to raise awareness about plastics pollution. He and his crew also raised money for AltaSea, while conducting thousands of tests for NASA and NOAA research projects.</li>
	<li>Launching a six-week pilot program with the Boys and Girls Clubs of LA Harbor to educate students on sustainable aquaculture and underwater robotics.</li>
</ul><p>We're so proud of the work our grantees have done to make LA the best place to connect, live, create, learn, and play. This is just the beginning. Subscribe to our newsletter 
	here to catch more updates as the year progresses, and let's get to work!<br></p><p>

<p><p>Wow! What a great six months we have had launching the Man2Man Project!</p><p>The M2M Project has two main components: </p><ol><li>The Young Dads Impact Team </li><li>The Adult Mentoring Program for the Young Dads </li></ol><p>The first group of Mentors are now actively engaged with their mentees. The Young Dads received training about male responsibility in pregnancy prevention and practical ways to deal with real-life situations. These trainings will be incorporated into the Young Dads Impact Team presentations at local schools in the San Fernando Valley, North Hills, and Pacoima!</p><p>The Young Dads Impact Team, a name they chose for themselves, has been busy honing their presentation skills so they are prepared to visit local middle and high schools this fall to talk about what it's REALLY like to be a Young Dad and how important it is for teenage guys to take responsibility for preventing pregnancy. </p><p>The major challenge we have faced with the M2M Project has been recruitment of volunteer mentors. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that volunteerism has decreased over the past five years and, compared to women, men are less likely to volunteer. To address and overcome this challenge, we have turned to pushing on social media, online networks, and presentations at community meetings. We also decided to establish two cohorts of mentors which has allowed the program to stagger the training and onboarding process. Currently, the second cohort of mentors is being interviewed, screened, and trained.</p><p>Although the M2M Project originally targeted metrics in LA2050's “Connect" goal category, we realize that the Project will also impact metrics in the “Live" goal category, as detailed below:</p><p>CONNECT:</p><ul><li>Rates of Volunteerism:<br><ul><li>Man2Man program provides community members the opportunity to volunteer as mentors to young dads.</li></ul><ul><li>Young Dad Impact Team members volunteer to conduct community presentations at local schools on the importance of teen pregnancy prevention.</li></ul></li><li>Social and Emotional Support<ul><li>Adult mentors provide Young Dads with encouragement, support, and guidance.</li></ul><ul><li>Young Dads weekly group sessions foster social connections among group members.</li></ul><ul><li>Young Dads participants receive ongoing coaching, personal development, and access to networks of support</li></ul></li></ul><p><br>LIVE:</p><ul><li>Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences:<br><ul><li>Young Dads report high exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).</li></ul><ul><li>Adult Mentors and Young Dad mentees are trained about the impact and prevalence of ACEs.</li></ul><ul><li>The Man2Man Project will be featured on ACEs community-of-practice website as a trauma-informed and resiliency building program.</li></ul></li><li>Resilient Communities:<ul><li>Young Dads and Mentors participating in the Man2Man Project develop skills that increase their resilience.</li><li>Man2Man mentors and mentees will plan a community volunteer day.</li></ul></li></ul><p><br>In the upcoming six months of the Project, we look forward to continuing our work with the mentor/mentee pairs and facilitating opportunities for meaningful and supportive relationships to develop. The mentors and mentees will convene as a group for some activities and will plan a community event for late summer.</p>If you have any questions about the Project or are interested in volunteering, please contact Brenda Hillhouse at 818/988-4430 or <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#294b5b4c474d48694f464f4a4807465b4e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0b69796e656f6a4b6d646d686a2564796c">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>

<p>It is the mid-year mark for our LA2050: Make LA the best place to PLAY! grant project. We want to take a time out from our gnarlatiously awesome, salty, and sandy times at the beach to share with everyone how our journey is unfolding.</p>
<p>A project of this magnitude has taken no small amount of planning. </p>
<p>Our original proposal was to bring four LA City park and recreation departments out to the beach for two weeks of surf camp. We met at Green Meadows with coordinators and directors from three other LA parks: Algin Sutton, Trinity, and Cypress. After a frank discussion about research goals and weekly expectations, the biggest question was about time commitment. Can we get the SAME 65 children to commit to summer camp for two weeks in a row? Turns out, nobody knew if we could get the consistency needed to collect the data we wanted.</p>
<p>So we deviated from our original proposal--instead of 10 days of immersion for our kids, we broke the summer up into one-week blocks and invited eight parks out to the beach. Our parks cover all areas of Los Angeles: North Hollywood, East LA, Downtown, and South Central LA. We opened the door for our partners at Algin Sutton, Cypress, and Green Meadows to reach out to other reliable coordinators at Denker, Yucca, and Hazard Parks. </p>
<p>Surf Bus committed to dressing and feeding all our students, park staff, and volunteers with healthy lunches for the duration of our summer calendar. We have learned that staying well hydrated with water and choosing whole foods like simple proteins, fruits, and vegetables creates maximal returns at the beach. We couldn't have had a great summer without our generous partners:</p>
<ul><li>Whole Foods agreed to give healthy snacks and fruit for 65 people everyday for the week of July 17-21</li><li>Everytable Santa Monica prepared fresh salads and grain bowls for us 3 days/week</li><li>Fellow My LA2050 grantee Altasea and the Cabrillo Aquarium prepared and delivered lunch for our budding marine scientists</li><li>Coolies Surf made special rashguard sets of shorts and tops for the children who do not have suitable bathing suits of their own. </li><li>Winds Bus partnered with Surf Bus to help provide transportation </li></ul>
<p>100% of our Surf Bus volunteers are students who surf on Surf Academy-run middle and high school surf teams. Truly, the project epitomizes Ohana Nalu (family wave) and the Spirit of Aloha. For the week,we worked with Valley Plaza, by day five, we had all forty-five kids calling their instructors "aunty" and "uncle," just like on the Hawaiian islands. </p>
<p>The Surf Bus Foundation is an organization dedicated to the transportation and expansion of scientific knowledge through tools like play and through the help of the LA2050 Challenge grant they were able to develop the Therapeutic Ocean Engagement: Surfing (T.O.E.S.). We have taken photos, kept daily journals, conducted short interviews, and collected anonymous before/after surveys from all students and staff from each park. We are charged with the responsibility doing an exponential amount of good! </p></p>

<p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://la2050.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/comfy/cms/files/125/files/original/14940114_1812464505663100_3281903712791998270_o.jpg" style="width: 512px; height: 341.043px;" rel="width: 512px; height: 341.043px;"></p><p>Big Citizen HUB has spent the last six months connecting 225 young people from all across Los Angeles.</p>
<p>These youth represent:</p><ul><li>60 zip codes and 57 school communities</li><li>34% male, 57% female, 1% gender non-conforming, 8% non disclosed</li><li>77% Latinx/Hispanic, 5% Asian American/Pacific Islander, 3% Caucasian/White, 3% African American/Black, 6% Mixed Race, 6% non disclosed<br></li></ul>
<p>Together on diverse teams, Big Citizens have been participating in dialogue, community immersion activities, and direct actions to address the critical issues dividing our cities, including Environmental Sustainability, Food Justice, Homelessness, Immigration, LGBTQ+ Equality, and Animal Rights. From making blankets for people experiencing homelessness, participating in the Free the People Immigration March, taking toxic tours and making seed bombs, to participating in a letter writing campaign to SeaWorld, these youth are learning how to take action on the issues that matter most to them, whether that be through direct service, mobilization, or speaking out and sharing their own stories.</p>
<p>This has already been an incredible year and we are excited to continue moving forward to harness youth assets and positive peer networks, ultimately contributing to a more just, open, and connected society.</p>
<p>As we approach the end of our program year, we expect to graduate 196 young people in mid-July. Big Citizens have collectively spent over 20,000 hours exploring issues of social justice with their peers and our 30+ community partners.</p>
<ul><li>Big Citizens receive social and emotional support from near-peer mentors</li><li>Big Citizens have gained skills in using our public transit system to explore LA</li><li>We have engaged 225 Big Citizens, along with their friends and family in volunteerism throughout the last six months. 83 of these youth are back for their 2nd or 3rd year with Big Citizen HUB.</li><li>Big Citizens come from 60 zip codes across LA, making important connections with youth outside of their neighborhood</li><li>Big Citizens also connect through social media and learn how to utilize these networks to increase the impact they can have on the issues they care about<br><br> </li></ul>
<p>It's also been an exciting year operationally! We've begun working with the Building Healthy Communities - Boyle Heights: Invest in Youth Campaign, furthering valuable partnerships through advocacy efforts for positive youth development programs in LA. We've also begun to build greater organizational capacity by bringing on a Director of Programs and a Director of Impact and Evaluation. This is especially exciting as capacity has been a challenge as we strive to create the highest quality positive youth development program for our participants. </p>
<p>This year we launched the use of a mobile technology to collect information about youth's real-time experiences during the program. This methodology, called Experience Sampling Method (ESM), signals youth at random time points throughout the program day with a brief survey that asks respondents about what they are doing and feeling in that moment. This approach provides us with data on the quality of program implementation and how youth are experiencing and interacting with program components. We plan to share evaluation findings through an impact report this fall, after the 2017 program is complete.</p>
<p>This has already been an incredible year and we are excited to continue moving forward to harness youth assets and positive peer networks, ultimately contributing to a more just, open, and connected society.</p>
