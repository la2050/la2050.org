<p><p>We are excited to share our conversation with Michael O'Gorman, Executive Director of the <a href="https://farmvetco.org/">Farmer Veteran Coalition</a> (FVC), a national nonprofit that works with veterans to cultivate a new generation of farmers and food leaders. Michael has been farming since 1970 and first began FVC in 2008 out of the back of his pickup truck.</p>
<p>Q: What motivated you to start your career in social impact?</p>
<p><em>A: Even as a young kid, I've always thought about what I will do in my life that will be impactful. I farmed because I loved it but also because I wanted to do something that was real, difficult, and that would give me a platform to have an impact. Farming had no hype to it. In a way, throughout my entire farming career I have thought about impact, about the people who worked for me, and the people who ate my food. Coming after 9/11 was the convergence of two major things â€“ men and women serving in the military who were coming from farm towns, and our farms that lacked men and women. I put two and two together and it seemed to amount to something greater. I knew I was onto something that no one else was doing and that would be impactful. But it became more than I ever imagined. And it had a major impact on me.</em></p>
<p>Q: What do you do in your current position?</p>
<p><em>A: As Executive Director I oversee the project, but I also think a lot about what we can do that will actually be of help to the most veterans. I try to assist them with any challenges. Having spent my career in agriculture, I think about veterans who want to start a life in agriculture and how we can help them succeed and stay with it.</em></p>
<p>Q: What one skill or resource has been indispensable to your career thus far?</p>
<p><em>A: As a vegetable farmer, I was attracted to the interplay of growing food and people. Vegetable production was like a team sport or group activity. People worked in unison with a common goal of creating a farm producing vegetables together. It took directing people to grow food as a communal creation. That lent itself to FVC; it's like my crew â€“ we're all growing food together and instilling a sense of common purpose and shared joy.</em></p></p>

<p><p>
	In this year's My LA2050 Grants Challenge, we received 285 proposals to make LA the best place to LIVE, LEARN, PLAY, CONNECT, and CREATE. We saw so many unique proposals working on every issue imaginable - civic engagement, food systems and sustainability, criminal justice reform, obesity, mental health, diversity in media, film, and television, homelessness, COVID-19 relief, and many more. If you didn't catch our last few blogs, we recapped trends in the proposals from each goal category: <a href="blog/trends-in-the-live-goal-category.html">LIVE</a>, <a href="blog/trends-in-the-learn-goal-category.html">LEARN</a>, <a href="blog/trends-in-the-play-goal-category.html">PLAY</a>, <a href="blog/trends-in-the-connect-goal-category.html">CONNECT</a>, and <a href="blog/trends-in-the-create-goal-category.html">CREATE</a>.<br>
</p><p>
	This week, we announced the 25 finalists in the <a href="http://challenge.la2050.org/">My LA2050 Grants Challenge</a>. Each of the finalist proposals will be up for a vote June 8th through June 15th. The results of voting will determine the size of the grant that each organization receives. But before we get to voting, here's some of the data we've gleaned from proposals to this year's grants challenge.
</p><p>
	<strong>Types of Organizations</strong>
</p><p>
	We're thrilled to have received 130+ more proposals than last year's grants challenge. We're grateful to every organization that participated in this year's challenge, especially given the uncertainty in our world. Of the 285 proposals we received in the challenge, 80 percent were from nonprofit organizations. About nine percent of proposals came from for-profit organizations, and another nine percent came from fiscally sponsored groups. We received five proposals from social enterprises or B-corps and three proposals from government entities. 60 percent of applicants had never applied to the grants challenge before.
</p><p>
	<strong>Organization Size</strong>
</p><p>
	A majority of organizations that applied to the grants challenge are on the smaller side in terms of staff with 70 percent of organizations reporting fewer than 20 employees. 43 percent of applicants are even smaller, reporting between zero and five employees. But, when it comes to organizational budgets, there was more of a range with 58 percent of applicants reporting annual operating budgets under $1 million. Of those organizations, 18 percent reported budgets in the range of $100,000 - $500,000. 42 percent of applicants have budgets greater than $1 million.
</p><p>
	<strong>Type of Proposal</strong>
</p><p>
	72 percent of applicants to the challenge sought funding to expand an existing program at their organization. 20 percent of proposals were seeking funding for a pilot program, and six percent were looking to fund the lateral application of a solution to a new issue area. Only one percent of proposals were seeking funding for research projects.
</p><p>
	<strong>Regional Impact</strong>
</p><p>
	We asked all 285 applicants to indicate which communities they would reach with their proposals. Applicants were given the option to select more than one geographic area or to select an overarching region â€” Los Angeles County, the City of Los Angeles, or the LAUSD. Nearly half of all proposals selected all of Los Angeles County, 38 percent of proposals selected South LA as a focus of their work, 32 percent selected Central LA, and 27 percent selected East LA.

	In this year's My LA2050 Grants Challenge, we received 25 submissions to the PLAY goal category. This goal category depicts a Los Angeles where people of all ages have easy access to clean, safe, and sustainable venues to enjoy the natural environment, arts and cultural resources, local beaches, and waterways. You can see a summary of every single PLAY proposal categorized by issue area <strong><a href="blog/making-la-the-best-place-to-play.html">here</a></strong>.<br>

Through pop-up events or volunteering, the goals of these proposals were to get people engaged with their communities, create safe, walkable neighborhoods, and increase the number of open space and park facilities. Organizations like the <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/los-angeles-neighborhood-initiative-lani/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/city-of-los-angeles-department-of-recreation-and-parks/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/nature-for-all/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Nature for All</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/ciclavia/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">CicLAvia</a> make us hopeful for a time when we can all gather together again! </li>
	<li><strong>The most commonly targeted metric in the PLAY category was 'youth sports participation.'</strong> This year 13 organizations aimed to improve the physical fitness of young athletes of all abilities through sports like lacrosse, baseball, and skateboarding. In doing so, they also hope to teach participants essential life skills and support their educational progress. These organizations include <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/harlem-lacrosse-los-angeles/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Harlem Lacrosse</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/los-angeles-dodgers-foundation/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Dodgers Foundation</a>, the<a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/the-urban-warehouse/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink"> Urban Warehouse</a>, and others.</li>
	<li>We also saw <strong>a trend in PLAY proposals encouraging Angelenos to get active not just for their physical health, but also for their mental wellness.</strong> Projects from the <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/american-heart-association/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">American Heart Association</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/up2us-inc/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Up2Us, Inc.</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/play/cedars-sinai-medical-center/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Cedars Sinai Medical Center</a> specifically highlighted how spending time outdoors and engaging in sports and recreation activities can improve the social and emotional health of participants.</li>
	<li>This year, <strong>we received more than double the number of proposals in the PLAY category compared to both 2018 and 2019.</strong> Although PLAY is still the smallest category in this year's challenge with 25 projects, we were excited to see such an increase from the previous two years. </li>

	In this year's My LA2050 Grants Challenge, we received 46 submissions to the CREATE goal category. This goal category depicts a Los Angeles that is thriving creatively with innovation in all sectors, from technology to the arts, spurring inclusive and equitable economic growth. You can see a summary of every single CREATE proposal categorized by issue area <a href="blog/making-la-the-best-place-to-create.html">here</a>.<br>
</p><p>
	Here are four trends we noticed in submissions to the CREATE goal category:
</p><ol>
	<li>In the CREATE category,<strong> nearly 50 percent of proposals seek to increase the number of minority- and women-owned businesses in Los Angeles.</strong> This was by far the most selected metric, which was also the case in our previous two grants challenges. Los Angeles is an incredibly diverse city, and this sustained trend tells us that Angelenos are focused on having a business ecosystem reflective of that diversity. Our vision for the year 2050 is that 50 percent of businesses will be women-owned, and 50 percent will be minority-owned. Organizations like <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/grid110/">Grid 110</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/smith-co-llc-dba-kolor-society/">Kolor Society</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/la-plaza-de-cultura-y-artes/">LA Plaza Cultura Y Artes</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/refoundry/">Refoundry</a>, and others are trying to make this vision a reality.</li>
	<li><strong>The second most popular metric among submissions to the CREATE category was 'employment in the creative industries.'</strong> The creative industries are a massive part of the Los Angeles economy, so it's no surprise that dozens of proposals are focused on securing career pathways and employment for diverse candidates. <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/truthseekers-inc/">Truthseekers Inc</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/los-angeles-center-of-photography/">the Los Angeles Center of Photography</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/the-alliance-for-media-arts-culture/">the Alliance for Media Arts + Culture</a>, and <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/las-fotos-project/">Las Fotos Project</a> are just a few of the proposals hoping to impact employment in the creative industries.</li>
	<li>In this goal category, <strong>workforce development is by far the most popular tactic for producing change.</strong> Whether it's creating inroads for the tech industry, media and film industries or the science and STEM fields, a majority of the 46 CREATE proposals rely on workforce development as a means of accomplishing their goal. Proposals in this goal category focus on a variety of populations - from formerly incarcerated individuals to foster youth and youth with disabilities - but ultimately share similar tactics. Examples of workforce development proposals include <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/altasea-at-the-port-of-los-angeles/">AltaSea</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/youth-business-alliance/">Youth Business Alliance</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/lost-angels-childrens-project/">Lost Angels Children's Project</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/coop-careers/">COOP Careers</a>, and many more. </li>
	<li><strong>The CREATE category received more proposals from for-profit businesses than any other category.</strong> Many of these businesses recognize and acknowledge that our economy thrives when small businesses are supported and all people have access to opportunities for employment. It's inspiring to see for-profits like <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/smith-co-llc-dba-kolor-society/">Kolor Society</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/startup-coil-llc/">Startup Coil LLC</a>, and <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/create/codemarket/">Codemarket</a> working towards greater community benefit.</li>

<p><p>The LEARN goal category received the highest number of submissions in this year's My LA2050 Grants Challenge, with 82 proposals focused on advancing educational opportunities from early education through college and setting a foundation for lifelong learning. You can see a summary of every single LEARN proposal categorized by issue area <strong><a href="blog/making-la-the-best-place-to-learn.html">here</a></strong>.</p><p>Below are five trends we noticed in submissions to the LEARN goal category:</p><ol><li>Nearly fifty percent of proposals in the LEARN category are seeking to positively impact high school graduation rates, especially for high-needs groups. Organizations are finding creative ways to encourage students to succeed in their education by providing support outside of the classroom in the form of wraparound services, peer leadership opportunities, arts programming, and more. Submissions in this area include <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/new-earth/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">New Earth</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/womens-voices-now/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Women's Voices Now</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/united-friends-of-the-children/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">United Friends of the Children</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/ryman-arts/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Ryman Arts</a>.</li><li>Organizations are not just focused on high school completion, but also increasing the number of young people of all backgrounds who continue to attend college. In this category, 45 percent of proposals seek to improve college matriculation rates in Los Angeles County. Tactics include preparation for the SAT and ACT, providing financial assistance for college, and mentorship programs. Some of these proposals came from <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/everydae/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Everydae</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/operation-jump-start/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">Operation Jump Start</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/costsbeyondtuition-org/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">CostsBeyondTuition.org</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/college-access-plan/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">College Access Plan</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/learn/collegespring/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink">CollegeSpring</a>.</li><li>As in the past My LA2050 Grants Challenges, we're seeing many proposals focus on preparing students for the workforce of the future.
