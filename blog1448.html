<p><p>We talked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamyakhavan">Kamy Akhavan</a>, Executive Director of the <a href="https://dornsife-center-for-political-future.usc.edu/">USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future</a>, to learn about his experience working in social impact and to get his advice for those who might want to work in policy, politics, or the nonprofit sector.</p><p><img src="https://la2050.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/comfy/cms/files/145/files/original/Spotlight_Series_-_Kamy_Akhavan.png" rel="width: 269px; height: 269px;" style="width: 269px; height: 269px;"></p><p><strong>Q: What motivated you to start your career in social impact?</strong></p><p>A: <em>I was born in the back seat of a taxi in Iran, moved to south Louisiana at age one, and ended up in Torrance, California for high school and UCLA for college. I lived in more than 20 places by the time I was 18 - from subsidized housing to a mobile home to hotels to big beautiful houses. My experience as a rootless immigrant taught me that people everywhere share human values that transcend our geography. I recognize that American democracy is precious, empowering, and inspiring to billions of people who long to enjoy freedom. My motivation to public service stems from wanting to relate to people on our shared values - what unites us versus what divides us. </em></p><p><strong>Q: What do you do in your current position?</strong></p><p>A: <em>My job is to run a top-tier educational organization that trains people in practical politics and inspires them to be civically engaged and to bridge divides. On a day-to-day basis, I work to develop programs that let students interact with elected officials, political operatives, academics, activists, and other national leaders so they can gain experience challenging others respectfully while having their own views challenged. Participants learn about issues, elections, each other, and effective ways to communicate and get things done together. In our sadly divided times, these skills are especially important to the future of American democracy.</em></p><p><strong>Q: What one skill or resource has been indispensable to your career thus far?</strong></p><p>A: <em>The skill of resilience has been indispensable. Resilience requires courage to ask tough questions and listen to, and even learn from, responses that can be offensive. Resilience requires vulnerability when expressing yourself honestly. Resilience requires strength when resisting bad influences or standing firm for your values. Building resilience comes from listening, critical thinking, humility, and developing your own moral and intellectual compass that guides you in all situations. The best way to learn resilience is to be uncomfortable then adjust.</em></p><p>If you're interested in learning more about his work, be sure to follow on Twitter: @kamyakhavan and @cpfpolfuture</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Why is this match being offered?</strong></p><p>The Goldhirsh Foundation is grateful to all the organizations that have applied to the My LA2050 Grants Challenge for the last six years. This match is a way to recognize the passion and work of these organizations and their supporters. We hope this will help people support their favorite organizations and find new organizations to support. <br></p><p><strong><span></span>How do I find an organization to give to for the LA2050 match?</strong></p><p>Visit <a href="https://archive.la2050.org/">https://archive.la2050.org/</a> and search for an organization using keywords, organization name, or issues you care about like “<a href="https://archive.la2050.org/search/?keywords=%22homelessness%22">homelessness</a>," “<a href="https://archive.la2050.org/search/?keywords=parks">parks</a>," or “<a href="https://archive.la2050.org/search/?keywords=%22voting%22">voting</a>." You can also search for an organization by category (right under the search bar). </p><p>In the search results, select an organization to learn more. If the organization is a non-profit organization in good standing with the IRS, you'll find a donation form through which you can make a one-time or monthly donation to the organization. Donations are accepted by credit card only at this time.</p><p><strong>How will my gift be matched?</strong></p><p>Your gift will be processed by our partners at <a href="https://www.pledgeling.com/">Pledgeling</a>, and matching funds from the Goldhirsh Foundation will be added on a first-come, first-matched basis. </p><p><strong>How much will be matched?<br></strong></p><p>The Goldhirsh Foundation will match up to $100 in donations per person. The match will be turned off on Friday December 20 at noon, or once $10,000 in donations have been made. Check-in with @LA2050 on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter for updates. </p><p><strong>Can I donate to more than one organization?</strong></p><p>Yes, please do! Matching funds will be applied to your gifts until you reach your limit of $100. (So, if you make a $40 gift to one organization, a $40 gift to another organization, and a $40 gift to a third organization, the Goldhirsh Foundation will match $40 for the first two gifts and $20 for the third gift). </p><p><strong>Are matching funds available to organizations not listed in the LA2050 Ideas Archive?</strong></p><p>No, only organizations listed in the LA2050 Ideas Archive are eligible for matching funds. </p><p><strong>How does an organization get added to the LA2050 Ideas Archive?</strong></p><p>Organizations are included in the LA2050 Ideas Archive if they have applied to the My LA2050 Grants Challenge. The next open call for applications will be in February 2020. <a href="https://la2050.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=81b6d7b4efb839b992bf7ae72&amp;amp;id=b16f498212">Sign up here to be notified about the next challenge</a>. </p><p><strong>If I donate on the organization's website, will it still be matched?</strong></p><p>No, only donations made via the LA2050 Ideas Archive site will be matched. </p><p><strong>I found an organization in the Ideas Archive, but I don't see a donation form.</strong></p><p>At this point, we are only able to facilitate donations to 501c3 non-profit organizations that are in good standing with the IRS. If you don't see a donation form on the page, it could be for the following reasons: </p><ol><li>The organization is a government, for-profit, or 501c4 organization. At this time, we do not have a way to make donations via website and Pledgeling to these types of organizations. But feel free to contact the organization directly to donate. </li><li>The organization has gone out of business or merged with another organization. </li><li>We do not have complete data for the organization and are not able to facilitate a donation at this time. </li></ol><p><strong>How do I know my donation was received?</strong></p><p>You will receive an email confirmation from Pledgeling within a few minutes of donating. Please review this email and make sure everything looks good. Please contact Pledgeling for any changes or help with your donation. </p><p><br></p></p>

<p><p>Feeling inspired by the projects in the <a href="blog/report-on-the-2019-my-la2050-grants-challenge.html">2019 My LA2050 Grants Challenge Report</a>? Every person has the power to make a difference. Here are a few ideas to get you started:<br></p><p>
	<b>1. Sign up for the LA2050 newsletter: </b>Twice a month we send updates from grantees and partners, job listings, local events, and more to keep you up-to-date on opportunities to get involved. <a href="https://la2050.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=81b6d7b4efb839b992bf7ae72&amp;amp;id=b16f498212">Sign up here.</a>
</p><p>
	<b>2. Volunteer: </b>Consider donating your time or skills to support a local organization or nonprofit that is working on a particular topic or cause that you are passionate about. Get started by <a href="blog/local-volunteer-opportunities.html">checking out these volunteer opportunities from LA2050 grantees.</a>
</p><p>
	<b>3. Replicate a great idea: </b>Did you see a project that made you think “we need this"? Take inspiration from one of the projects from this year's grants challenge or browse the LA2050 Ideas Archive with more than six years of proposals from amazing organizations. Pick one that inspires you, and reach out to the organization to see how you can help bring the project to life for your community.
</p><p>
	<b>4. Collaborate and partner: </b>Look for opportunities to engage with local organizations, nonprofits, and businesses that are working on social causes directly related to your industry. If you're looking for ideas, <a href="metrics.html">take a look at our metrics</a> to identify where you can make progress toward each goal.
</p><p>
	<b>5. Make impact locally: </b>Consider everything you do an opportunity to make an impact! Take small steps every day that can have a major impact in the long run, such as supporting your local farmer's market, purchasing sustainable products, participating in the census, or getting involved with your local neighborhood council. Use your voice, strategize and organize around a particular issue that matters to you, such as improving access to healthy foods, reducing homelessness, or reducing your carbon footprint.
</p><p>
	<b>6. Start conversations: </b>Some of the biggest social change movements start with a simple question. Start conversations with your friends, family, and co-workers about things you learned from these proposals or trends from this grants challenge. From educating your neighbors, coworkers, and friends about the U.S. census to bringing a “pop-up" or mobile experience to your community to using trends for academic research and school projects related to social impact, everything can spark change.

<p><p>Every year, the Goldhirsh Foundation operates the <a href="https://activation.la2050.org/">My LA2050 Grants Challenge</a> in which we solicit proposals from nonprofit, for-profit, and government organizations for projects that will better our region. Through the My LA2050 Grants Challenge, Angelenos help us determine how to grant $1,000,000 in Los Angeles. After each grants challenge, we identify and examine trends from the submissions. We will be releasing the trends from <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/winners/">the 2019 challenge</a> soon, so I wanted to look back at five trends that emerged from last year's submissions:</p><p><strong><span></span>“On-Ramps” for Women </strong></p><p><span></span>2018 was dubbed “The Year of the Woman” and brought a surge in women's engagement in politics, business, and civic life. Applicants reflected this trend through the many proposals focused on providing “on-ramps” for women in key industries like politics, finance, and the arts.</p><p><strong><span></span>Civic Engagement and Voting</strong></p><p><span></span>Angelenos were craving greater involvement in the political process. We saw several proposals aimed at fostering civic engagement, from involvement in local politics to increased voter turnout.</p><p><strong><span></span>Homelessness</strong></p><p><strong><span></span></strong>We saw a number of proposals related to homelessness, ranging from service provision to high-level policy and advocacy work. Organizations across LA County were harnessing the momentum of legislation like Measure H and Prop HHH by advocating for more affordable housing, while also informing Angelenos about the realities of homelessness, the fragility of local housing, and the benefits of being a YIMBY (not a NIMBY).</p><p><strong><span></span>Creative Workforce Preparation</strong></p><p><span></span>While science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) workforce preparation has been popular for a number of years, in 2018 we saw proposals that merged STEM with the arts and creative industries. Some of our favorite examples of these projects were preparing youth for a workforce where the line between innovation and art has already become less clear.</p><p><strong><span></span>Small Business and Entrepreneurs</strong></p><p><span></span>Small businesses are the backbone of LA's economy, and entrepreneurs demonstrate the abundance of Angelenos' creativity. Many of last year's proposals recognized the need to invest more in our makers and workers so that the city's economic spirit can flourish.</p>
