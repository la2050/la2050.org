<p><p>In this year's My LA2050 Grants Challenge, we received 67 submissions to the CONNECT goal category. This goal category depicts a future where every resident in our region is empowered to engage and interact with their fellow Angelenos, move around our city efficiently, and contribute meaningfully to the civic process. You can see a summary of every single CONNECT proposal categorized by issue area <a href="/blog/making-la-the-best-place-to-connect.html">here</a>.<br></p>
<p>Here are four trends we noticed in submissions to the CONNECT goal category:</p>
<ol><li>While COVID-19 means we're safer home, Angelenos are working to stay connected by any means possible, giving this category new meaning. We saw a trend in proposals aspiring to revive our connections to the city and each other post-pandemic. Proposals like <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/inspiring-service/">Inspiring Service</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/insightla/">InsightLA</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/union-rescue-mission/">Union Rescue Mission</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/coalition-for-humane-immigrant-rights-chirla/">CHIRLA</a>, and more give us so much hope for the future of our region! On issues like homelessness and immigrant rights, these organizations want to inspire and encourage people to get active and be part of the solutions to some of LA's most intractable problems.</li><li>Along those lines, 67% of submissions to the CONNECT category were targeting the 'social and emotional support' metric. From <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/citizens-of-culture/">mental health services </a>and <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/trauma-informed-la-tila/">trauma response</a> to <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/social-cipher/">an educational video game for children with autism</a>, there are many creative ways in which organizations are looking to ensure that Angelenos have sufficient support. It's clear to us that people are yearning for deeper social and emotional connection during this period of physical distancing. Among the organizations focused on impacting social and emotional support in Los Angeles are <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/citizens-of-culture/">Citizens of Culture</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/social-cipher/">Social Cipher</a>, the <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/indigenous-circle-of-wellness-sooh-shinálí-sister-project/">Indigenous Circle of Wellness</a>, and more.</li><li>We also noticed a desire to utilize and activate volunteers across all issue areas. Volunteering is one of the most important ways we can engage with our local communities, so it's no surprise that organizations like <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/l-a-works/">LA Works</a>, <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/826la/">826LA</a>, and <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/plus-me-project/">PLUS ME Project</a> are hoping to increase 'rates of volunteerism' in the region.</li><li>More than one-third of the CONNECT proposals focused on the transformative power of public art to inspire civic engagement and bring people together. Public music performances from <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/neighborhood-music-school/">the Neighborhood Music School</a>, a puppet festival from <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/skirball-cultural-center/">the Skirball Cultural Center</a>, and a pop-up “dancemobile” from <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/connect/heidi-duckler-dance/">Heidi Duckler Dance</a> are just a few of the creative arts-based events that groups are looking forward to once we can all gather again. </li></ol></p>

<p><p>
	One of the changes to this year's <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/">My LA2050 Grants Challenge</a> is that Social Venture Partners Los Angeles (SVPLA) is reviewing and evaluating all proposals submitted. The evaluation process began in the beginning of April and will end when 25 finalist organizations are selected at the end of May. (<a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/timeline/">See the challenge timeline here</a>).<br>
</p><p>
	According to Christine Margiotta, Executive Director of SVPLA, “It feels particularly meaningful in this moment of crisis to be able to help amplify powerful and impactful work happening in LA through the My LA2050 Grants Challenge."</p><p><strong><img src="https://la2050.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/comfy/cms/files/152/files/original/SVPLA.png" alt="Svpla" rel="width: 308px; height: 307.483px;" style="width: 308px; height: 307.483px;"><br></strong></p><p><strong>The Evaluatio</strong><strong>n Process</strong><br></p><p>
	For the My LA2050 Grants Challenge, 38 SVP members will serve as reviewers. They received training from SVP and Goldhirsh Foundation teams to familiarize themselves with the LA2050 goals, metrics, and review process. After being screened for conflicts of interest, members were then assigned to review proposals for one of five goal categories.</p><p>
	Each evaluation team will take into consideration a range of factors to support the diversity of lived and learned expertise in addition to racial, age, and gender diversity. All proposals are read by at least two reviewers, who each have two weeks to score proposals. From there, SVPLA will meet with each evaluation team to further review and discuss the applicants in their category. The five strongest applicants will be submitted to the Goldhirsh Foundation as SVP's top tier recommendations.
</p><p>
	<strong>Excited to Review and Spread the Word</strong>
</p><p>
	Margiotta says SVPLA members look forward to the process, “Our SVP Partners are excited to have the opportunity to learn about so many great organizations working on a variety of pressing issues within our communities. They are curious, passionate, and engaged in a range of initiatives throughout the region, so they can also help spread the word about the great work of these organizations."
</p><p>
	Similarly the LA2050 team is excited to work with SVPLA, whose team and members have many years of experience reviewing grant applications and pitches for funding. They bring a thoughtful eye to the proposal review process as they embody a wide range of experiences, coming from professional fields spanning nonprofit and philanthropy, government, business, and more.</p><p>
	<strong>About SVP</strong>
</p><p>
	Social Venture Partners is an international network with over 3,500 engaged members in 40 cities. Its mission is to catalyze long-term social change in Los Angeles by connecting engaged philanthropists with innovative nonprofits.
</p><p>
	Members of SVP LA are individuals committed to creating a more equitable, just, and thriving Los Angeles. They learn from nonprofit leaders while donating their money, time, skills, and networks, thereby cultivating meaningful relationships and amplifying impact.

<a href="blog1d84.html?tag=Grants+Challenge">Grants Challenge</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class='blogpost-shadedbox richtext'>
<p><p>
	We received 66 submissions in the 
	<a href="/goals/live.html">LIVE goal category</a> for this year's My LA2050 Grants Challenge. At LA2050, the LIVE goal category represents our vision for a happy, healthy, and sustainable region in which residents have the economic means and cultural capital to lead active lives and benefit from a thriving environment. You can see a summary of every single LIVE proposal categorized by issue area <a href="/blog/making-la-the-best-place-to-live.html">here</a>.<br>
</p><p>
	Here are four trends we noticed in submissions to the LIVE goal category:
</p><ol>
	<li>Unsurprisingly, <strong> a common theme among the proposals was COVID-19: its impact on our region and how we might best approach recovery.</strong> Having our grants challenge amid the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, we anticipated at least a few proposals aimed at helping those impacted by job loss, the inadequacies of our social safety nets, and other complications resulting from the “Safer at Home" orders. We are glad to see organizations being responsive to this need and adapting their current offerings and services to benefit Angelenos that are particularly vulnerable. Some of the organizations that focused their proposals on responding to COVID-19 include<a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/lift-los-angeles/"> LIFT</a>,<a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/the-dream-center-foundation/"> The Dream Center Foundation</a>,<a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/la-forward/"> LA Forward</a>,<a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/valley-intercommunity-council/"> Valley InterCommunity Council</a>, and<a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/southern-california-public-radio-kpcc-laist/"> LAist</a>.</li>
	<li>Not surprisingly then, <strong>the #1 metric targeted by submissions in the LIVE category was 'resilient communities.'</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed inequities and vulnerabilities that exist in our ability to respond to poverty and crisis. More than 25 proposals are seeking to build community resilience through the provision of trauma-informed mental health services, improving food systems and sustainability, and innovating to house people experiencing homelessness.</li>
	<li><strong>65% of the LIVE submissions intended to impact either the 'food insecurity' metric or the 'access to healthy food' metric.</strong> Organizations like<a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/hollywood-food-coalition/"> The Hollywood Food Coalition</a>,<a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/united-parents-and-students/"> United Parents And Students</a>,<a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/san-pedro-meals-on-wheels/"> Meals on Wheels of San Pedro</a>,<a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/sprouts-of-promise-foundation/"> Sprouts of Promise Foundation</a>, and many more proposed providing healthy, fresh groceries and meals to thousands of vulnerable families, students, and older adults.</li>
	<li><strong>We also noticed a trend in repurposing existing space in creative, new ways to be used for housing.</strong> For example,<a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/los-angeles-room-board/"> Los Angeles Room &amp; Board's Open Spaces project</a> fosters partnerships with college student housing programs to reimagine the use of their vacant dorm rooms to provide stability to community college students experiencing housing insecurity.<a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/renovation-planners/"> </a><a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/safe-place-for-youth-a-project-of-community-partners/">Safe Place For Youth's Safe Pods for Youth</a> proposes working with PodShare to use its pods as a temporary housing solution for people experiencing homelessness, and <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/2020/live/renovation-planners/">Renovation Planners' Urban $marts LA</a> will help local residents build additional dwelling units.</li>

<p><p>“What are the coordinates of where we're moving to?”<br></p>
<p>The teacher's question is met with a flurry of raised hands. He picks a student to answer, she gets it right, and the class moves into independent working time. One student is levels ahead, already unlocking the tougher coding challenges beyond the first five “training wheels” exercises. Another two students point out mistakes in each other's coding and move forward together. The sound of furious typing is punctuated by the occasional “Ohh” and “Yes!” as things click into place.</p>
<p>These students are 5th graders and already learning how to write code.</p>
<p>Coding is complex work, so the design of 9 Dots' Computer Science (CS) pathway prepares students for the difficulty of simplifying their work – an easily under-estimated process that requires high-level analytical and problem-solving skills. From the way 9 Dots plans their curriculum to work like building blocks to the gamified interface they created to support both students and teachers, their focus on cultivating a truly engaging classroom environment is what makes their impact on the next generation so significant.</p>
<p>3rd and 4th graders begin their coding journey by navigating a graphical interface that familiarizes them with the structure and syntax of programming. By the time they enter a 5th grade classroom, many become quickly proficient in typing out their own code, with several even applying and broadening this knowledge on their own through an after-school robotics club. </p>
<p>While being fluent in programming languages is undeniably a useful skill for the future, a 9 Dots classroom emphasizes the multiple useful skills one picks up when learning how to code. The classroom is quiet as students troubleshoot their own work, double-checking their code for spelling errors. With all their focus and attention to detail, it was impossible to tell that they had just come back from recess.</p>
<p>Much of this environment is carefully cultivated by the teacher who hands laptops out ten minutes before recess so students can play with the 9 Dots interface. Details like adding a robot icon to the instruction page and using shapes and colors to visualize the functions they're coding keeps the interface intuitive for students. It also eases their transition into a math class where they might recognize why coordinates are necessary to plot a graph. On the back-end, teachers are able to track the progress of students in real-time and assist those stuck on an easier level who are hesitant to ask for help.</p>
<p>As you leave the classroom you notice a poster hangs on the wall reminding students that they can use CS as a superpower for art, sustainability, social justice, and more, it's not at all difficult to feel hopeful at our glimpse of the future.</p></p>

<p><p>When the going gets tough, the tough get going. We continue to be inspired by our grantees who are adapting, innovating, and championing their missions more than ever during this time.</p><p><a href="https://archive.la2050.org/defy-ventures-inc/">Defy Ventures</a> has paused its in-prison programs due to the California Department of Corrections restrictions on visitors at this time, but Defy's staff hasn't skipped a beat. The team has been able to connect with participants to continue with the EIT (“Entrepreneur-in-Training") curriculum, and has shifted to virtual meetings for post-release and community programs. In addition, they're starting virtual book clubs and launching <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTqhOxI1a-ggPecufBPpz1JS845Xkln0Fx48cVFk09eie_bA/viewform?emci=c8e5e219-c073-ea11-a94c-00155d03b1e8&amp;emdi=bdbff830-4074-ea11-a94c-00155d03b1e8&amp;ceid=8149075">a letter-writing campaign</a> so that volunteers and post-release EITs can send words of encouragement to in-prison EITs.</p><p><a href="https://archive.la2050.org/rise-inc/">Rise</a> reallocated a small portion of its project budget to provide immediate shelter to 40 local college students living in their car or on the streets. The goal: to use the time in a temporary facility to find permanent housing for these students. Rise has also continued its work with local college student organizers, shifting from in-person to digital advocacy methods.</p><p><a href="https://archive.la2050.org/rock-the-vote/">Rock the Vote</a> moved its Census “Create-a-thon" to an innovative digital gathering. Fortunately, the “Create-a-thon" was all about expressing creativity through the use of digital tools and platforms. The kick-off and award ceremonies were conducted virtually while a Slack workspace was created so that participants and event organizers could share resources, announcements, and questions about the Census in real time. </p><p><a href="https://archive.la2050.org/east-la-community-corporation-elacc/">The Street Vendor Coalition</a> responded swiftly to alleviate the negative economic impact of COVID-19 on local micro-businesses and their workers. The coalition created the <a href="https://www.inclusiveaction.org/covid19response">Street Vendor Emergency Fund</a> to raise the money needed to provide $400 in direct cash assistance to vendors who are unable to access government assistance.</p><p><a href="https://archive.la2050.org/the-youth-movement-against-alzheimers/">The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's</a> coordinated an alternative to its in-home caregiving model given concerns around older adults and COVID-19. The program, “E-Meal," will combat isolation by setting up virtual dinner meetings via phone or video to connect YMAA's volunteers with older adults. Not only does E-Meal encourage social interaction, but it also gives older adults a venue to express their need for resources.</p><p><a href="https://archive.la2050.org/natural-history-museum-of-los-angeles-county/">The Natural History Museum</a> has closed its local museums and paused all in-person programming. But NHM's Community Science team is accustomed to using creative, mobile methods to encourage Angelenos to explore nature on their own. One example: the upcoming <a href="https://citynaturechallenge.org/">2020 City Nature Challenge</a>, an international effort to mobilize people to find and document plants and wildlife in cities across the globe using their own smartphones and cameras.</p><p><a href="https://archive.la2050.org/826la/">826LA</a> is continuing to provide its free tutoring, writing workshops, and support services to students, teachers, and families both online and over the phone. 826LA was motivated to make the shift to virtual methods in part because of the team's belief that storytelling can be a powerful tool in difficult times. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o8H8y-65lzjt_cka_yl_76-iBAs88DlrWWc9uAdLvAw/edit">See 826LA's digital resource hub for families here.</a></p><p><a href="https://archive.la2050.org/harlem-lacrosse/">Harlem Lacrosse</a> adapted proactively to the challenges faced by students, families, and teachers due to COVID-19. Program Directors served as “Resource Catalysts" to disseminate information from schools about virtual learning, meal distribution, and more. Meanwhile, the Leadership Team created virtual platforms and streamlined curricula to continue delivering academic support, athletic training, and social-emotional learning virtually. Some activities: live workouts, lacrosse jeopardy games, and an age-appropriate discussion on the coronavirus. </p><p><a href="https://archive.la2050.org/9-dots/">9 Dots</a> has designed new remote learning options for its Get Coding and Academy students and will be offering webinar lessons to a full grade level at a time. 9 Dots is also launching this year's CS Education Heroes awards as a virtual campaign by soliciting videos from the community about why CS education and teachers are so important. </p><p><br><br></p><p><br><br><br></p></p>
