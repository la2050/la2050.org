<p>--------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Philanthropy&rsquo;s Role in Securing Our Elections (June 9, 2020 @ 2:00pm ET)</p>

<p>Philanthropy has a critical and immediate role to play in ensuring the health and effectiveness of our election systems. &nbsp;Ensuring free and secure elections has moved beyond a place of partisanship; it has become a critical component of our disaster response to the COVID-19 pandemic. States and localities are sprinting to implement new voting procedures and rules, and the Iowa caucus debacle reminded us that accelerated implementations of changes can be risky. The necessary but hazardous rush towards implementation of safe voting will fall most heavily on states and municipalities facing massive budget shortfalls.</p>

<p>In response, several philanthropic partners are launching Partnership for Safe Voting 2020 in an effort to help focus vital philanthropic and field activities in a strategic and tightly coordinated way &ndash; from civic engagement efforts to message campaigns to accountability at the ballot box, there are urgent gaps to fill. Learn about this philanthropic effort to address pressing needs and support strategic coordination of currently disparate activities.</p>

<p>This webinar is invite-only and will be attended by people in the civic engagement space.</p>

<p>Tanya Clay House, State Infrastructure Fund<br />
Jenny Flanagan, Trusted Elections Fund<br />
Joe Goldman, Democracy Fund<br />
Laleh Ispahani, Open Society Foundations<br />
Ashley Spillane, Civic Action Fund and Voter Engagement Fund<br />
