          <dl class='richtext'><p><strong>Mission</strong><br />
A Place Called Home provides a safe, nurturing environment with proven programs in arts, education and wellness for the young people in South Central Los Angeles to help them improve their economic conditions and develop healthy, fulfilling and purposeful lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>APCH delivers its programs via a membership model that provides enrolled youth and families with services at no cost. Since inception, we have served more than 22,000 youth, and another 150,000 community members through civic, cultural, educational, and distribution events. This year we will serve about 1,000 unduplicated enrolled members ages 8 through mid-twenties in core programs, plus about 10,000 family and community members through supportive services and events. APCH&rsquo;s programs are offered throughout the academic year in an afterschool and weekend model and during summer in an all-day camp format. Our programs sequentially support self-empowerment, build resiliency, encourage skill acquisition and scholastic achievement, and inspire discovery.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
A Place Called Home is expanding and there are exciting plans and opportunities ahead. The Director of Counseling will provide strong leadership for APCH&rsquo;s mental health and case management services and respective staff, driving and overseeing the department&rsquo;s arc, daily work and advancement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>APCH is seeking a leader who, in collaboration with others, will re-envision the possibilities for providing mental health and case management services in the context of a community-based youth services organization in South Central Los Angeles, and lead in the implementation of this new departmental vision. They will develop a highly-effective and professional scope of services to serve the APCH membership community and provide additional limited services for the community at large.&nbsp;</p>

<p>APCH is distinctive for its holistic wraparound approach that addresses multiple areas of need including physical and mental health, nutrition, and family dynamic and function, as well as scholastic achievement and socioemotional development. Our case managers and clinicians in the Counseling Department ensure that the members&rsquo; daily care and learning experience is both informed by an awareness of trauma and focused on a process of healing. APCH counselors and program staff meet weekly to discuss member development and behavior, identify member and family issues as they arise, and work collaboratively to ameliorate them. Our highest-risk youth are screened and consistently monitored for depression and trauma, new members are on-boarded by case managers, and all staff are trained by the counseling team for mental health sensitivity and awareness. Care and unconditional regard for the whole child is the foundation upon which APCH was built, and is the starting point for all of our youth development and education programs. Family counseling and case management is also provided by our counseling team.</p>
