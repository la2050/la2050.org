          <dl class='richtext'><p><strong>Title:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Interim Education Program Coordinator<br />
<strong>Rate:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;$30/hour @ 25 hours/week<br />
<strong>Dates: </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;October 1, 2020 through January 31, 2021, with the possibility of extension</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>The Vincent Price Art Museum Foundation seeks an interim Program Coordinator for the newly developed Museum Studies Certificate Program (MSCP), a diversity pipeline program at the Vincent Price Art Museum (VPAM) and East Los Angeles College (ELAC). This program aims to cultivate a new generation of museum professionals amongst historically underrepresented people of color by providing students early exposure to museum practice, new avenues to economic mobility, and pathways to meaningful careers. The position will last approximately four months (October 2020-January 2021) or until ELAC hires a permanent, full-time employee. The interim coordinator will be encouraged to apply for the ELAC permanent position.</p>

<p>The Museum Studies Certificate Program Coordinator is chiefly responsible for the core administrative and programmatic operations of the MSCP and liaising between VPAM, ELAC, MSCP students, and other on-campus and off-campus stakeholders. The Interim Coordinator will oversee the MSCP&rsquo;s wraparound services designed to support student success and program completion, including key program components such as internships, a guest speaker and workshop series, supporting and tracking student progress, as well as conducting ongoing program outreach and recruitment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MSCP is a seven-course program (21-units) that provides a broad foundation of knowledge and professional work experience in the museum sector. Open to all students at East Los Angeles College, the program draws upon coursework in Art History, Library Science, Studio Art, Anthropology, and Archaeology, and includes museum internships and unique academic and professional development opportunities. The program is designed to accompany the Associate of Arts for Transfer (AAT) degree in Art History, which together can be completed in 2 years of full-time study at East Los Angeles College. The MSCP may also be pursued as a stand-alone program for students with a general interest in museums.</p>

<p>Students can expect to gain knowledge and experience in a range of museum professions and topics, including curatorial practice, conservation science, collections management and registration, education and public programs, communications, and nonprofit management. Additionally, the Vincent Price Art Museum serves as a critical component of the program, hosting information sessions, workshops, lectures, and academic/career counseling by experts in the field. As one of the few museums located at a California Community College, the Vincent Price Art Museum serves as a unique educational resource, classroom, incubator, and training ground for participating students.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Typical Duties</strong></p>

<p>Oversees internships required for all eligible MSCP students including part-time, semester-long museum internships at partnering Los Angeles area institutions, and full-time, month-long internships at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC as part of the Smithsonian Undergraduate Internship Program. Oversees all aspects of coordinating the internships, including the student application process, logistic coordination with partnering organizations, supporting student success, and conducting intern and intern supervisor evaluation surveys.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Works with museum and college staff to organize a guest speaker and specialized workshop series bringing distinguished museum professionals who are seasoned leaders and experts in the field in direct contact with students, to demonstrate career goals and pathways, as well as to provide hands-on experiences in technical areas of museum practice. Serves as the primary liaison with guest speakers and workshop leaders, and promotes the series via digital platforms to serve as a MSCP recruitment tool on campus and off. &nbsp;Plans, implements, and reports on the series, including conducting speaker and student surveys.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tracks and collects student data, including coursework, retention, program completion, degree acquisition, and transfer rates, as well as tracking degree holders&rsquo; job acquisition via annual survey as the program grows. Tracks and reports on all student internships, including student and intern supervisor evaluation survey findings and report-outs, as well as student evaluation surveys for workshops to ensure maximum impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conducts ongoing outreach and recruitment to local high schools, other community colleges in the Los Angeles Community College District, as well as engaging the ELAC campus community to build enrollment, awareness, and support for MSCP. Recruitment will primarily consist of sharing program information, scheduling visits and tours, pre-visit communications, information sessions provided in conjunction with VPAM tours, and follow-up communications. Tracks and reports on recruitment partnerships with targeted high schools and community colleges, and makes recommendations to grow the outreach contact list.&nbsp;</p>
