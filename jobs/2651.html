          <dl class='richtext'><p>New Media Ventures is hiring a Head of Investments! This is a great fit for someone with experience in for-profit investing and strong insight into dynamics around oppression, identity, power, and privilege. You&#39;ll lead our grant-making and investment work and join the leadership team of a uniquely impactful organization at a critical time for our democracy.</p>

<p>One of NMV&rsquo;s goals is to democratize access to capital in the progressive movement, and we strongly encourage applications from people from the communities the investment, philanthropy, and tech industries have systematically excluded. Further details below, and please apply by end of day on Monday, June 29th.</p>

<p>New Media Ventures&nbsp;(NMV) is a mission-driven venture fund and investor network focused on innovation to support our democracy and advance progressive change. Our mission is to find, support, and finance companies and organizations that are telling new stories, building advocacy movements, and catalyzing civic engagement. Over the past 10 years, we have supported nearly 90 promising startups, many of which are now widely-recognized pillars of the social change community, from Hearken and Blavity to Swing Left, Mijente, and PushBlack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are looking to hire a Head of Investments to lead our grant-making and investment work. This is an opportunity to join the leadership team of a uniquely impactful organization at a critical time for our democracy.</p>

<p>We believe that innovation comes in many different fiscal forms, which is why NMV has built an unusual and effective fund structure that allows us to both make investments in for-profit companies and grants to nonprofit organizations to maximize our impact. We invest at the seed and pre-seed stage in a company&rsquo;s lifecycle, and occasionally make follow-on investments in series A. We make most of our investments via our annual Open Call, a process we have developed to source promising entrepreneurs, including those with less access to traditional funding networks. Over the past five years, our deal-flow from the Open Call has grown 10x. We also consider additional investments and grants throughout the year as opportunities arise.</p>

<p>One of NMV&rsquo;s goals is to democratize access to capital in the progressive movement. Our work is guided by a commitment to collective liberation and undoing the ways the political and economic elite have oppressed people of color, women, First Nations, disabled people, LGTBQ+ communities, and more. We believe that social change is best led by people with successful track records of fighting for justice. We strongly encourage applications from people from the communities the investment, philanthropy, and tech industries have systematically excluded.</p>

	<li>Develop investment recommendations to share with our network of aligned investors.</li>
