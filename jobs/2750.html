          <dt>Description</dt>
          <dl class='richtext'><p>Under the direction and guidance of the Director, Homelessness Initiatives, the Senior Manager will be responsible for critical aspects of Home For Good&rsquo;s strategies focusing on older adults and seniors. Home For Good is the largest non-governmental agent working on the issue of homelessness in LA County, a driving force and backbone in creating systematic change that brings more people inside again.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Working alongside a dynamic and innovative team of implementers, the Senior Manager will have the opportunity to be at the center of this inspiring and historic effort, leading our collaborative effort to create a comprehensive strategy to quickly end older adult and senior homelessness in LA County - with focused attention on ensuring homelessness among older Black residents is extremely rare, brief, and non-recurring.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The work environment is fast-paced and energized, focused on continuous learning and improvement both internally and out in the field. As part of a management team of Home For Good, the Senior Manager will support coalition building, collaborative planning, and execution of strategic funding that pilot innovations, build cross-sector capacity between the aging and homelessness systems, and advance racial justice in partnership with public and private stakeholders.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The ideal candidate will demonstrate a deep passion for addressing systemic issues and injustices, possess a strong work-ethic, enjoy dynamic problem-solving, operate with a team &amp; mission-first mindset, and exhibit a track record of cultivating easy, meaningful, and productive relationships with diverse partners.</p>

	<li>Statistically significant year-over-year increases in the number of LA County adults 55 and older who exit homelessness to permanent housing, compared to baseline; and, continued yearly decreases in the relative share of 55 and older adults experiencing homeless as counted in the annual Point in Time (PIT) Count for the Los Angeles Continuum of Care
	<ul>
		<li>~7,000 seniors exit homelessness through permanent housing placements and other pathways by the end of 2021</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Statistically significant year-over-year decreases in the number of 55 and older adults experiencing homelessness for the first time in LA County, with even stronger performance among Black residents in that age cohort</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Statistically significant year-over-year increases in the percentage of eligible seniors, particularly Black seniors, enrolled in SSI and other benefits</li>
	<li>Better health indicators for senior adults experiencing homelessness, including increased health insurance coverage increased engagement in primary care as evidenced by fewer missed appointments, higher completions of annual wellness visits, and higher rates of medical screenings (i.e. colon cancer, mammograms) and higher completion of age-appropriate vaccinations (i.e. pneumonia, shingles, influenza)</li>
	<li>Produce a system-level strategic roadmap for unaccompanied seniors experiencing or at risk of homelessness that creates clarity among clients, partners, and stakeholders about how advocacy, resources, programs, and systems will align to make more progress on housing the target population with transformative potential to simultaneously reduce the scale and cost of senior homelessness on our healthcare system</li>
	<li>Leverage virtual technology to establish a safe and sustainable management and implementation infrastructure that ensures the strategies outlined in the roadmap are resourced, coordinated, implemented, and monitored</li>
