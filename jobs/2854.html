<p>Specifically, this position will support the Health Equity Manager in the management of our Regional Health Equity work with our member health departments and support implementation of our equity actions in partnership with community advocacy and/or organizing groups across Southern California. This position will also assist with our Advancing Equity training and capacity building opportunities with our hospital/health system and government partners. The successful applicant will have a proven track record that demonstrates their ability to effectively partner with multiple sectors and manage complex projects and initiatives involving public health, health equity and racial justice, and policy change strategies.</p>

<p>The ideal candidate will be a passionate advocate of health equity and racial justice, with strong knowledge of the underlying root causes of health and inequity and capacity to educate and inform others. The selected candidate will have experience elevating equity challenges and policy solutions in a range of political and professional environments. The successful applicant will have a track record demonstrating both courage and compassion to facilitate difficult conversations, the ability to lead training sessions on sensitive issues, and possessing the poise and talent to constructively engage various partners on consensus decision-making.</p>

<p>This position is ideal for a versatile and dedicated health equity and racial justice professional who can manage several projects that bring about successful policy, systems, and institutional changes across Southern California.</p>

<p>This is a remote, full-time position based in Southern California and the candidate will work primarily from their home office.<br />
