<p><strong>Background of the Homeless Employment and Training Project</strong></p>

<p>The Homeless Training and Employment Project addresses chronic homelessness as a problem of racial injustice as well as a problem of inadequate income. &nbsp;The Project provides comprehensive services and skill development that lead to full-time jobs that pay a living wage for rent and a stable life for individuals who will otherwise become persistently homeless.</p>

<p>Insufficient money to pay rent contributes to homelessness just as much as the lack of affordable housing. The most frequent explanation homeless adults give for their lack of housing is the loss of a job, resulting in their inability to pay their rent. Two-thirds of homeless adults in Los Angeles County make an effort to earn money.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The connection between unemployment and homelessness is strong. This has provided the basis for accurate predictive modelling by the Economic Roundtable of homeless outcomes for unemployed workers. This predictive analytic screening tool is described in &ldquo;Early Intervention to Prevent Persistent Homelessness,&rdquo;&nbsp;<meta charset="utf-8" /><b id="docs-internal-guid-4c65fab5-7fff-a7a3-daae-751c02948824"><a href="https://economicrt.org/publication/early-intervention-to-prevent-persistent-homelessness/">https://economicrt.org/publication/early-intervention-to-prevent-persistent-homelessness/</a>.</b></p>

<p>The project has four distinctive features:<br />
1. Predictive screening tools are used to identify individuals at high risk of becoming persistently homeless, at the onset of their homelessness, when they still have the greatest motivation and capability to find a job.&nbsp;<br />
2. Project partners, including researchers, labor unions, advocacy groups, nonprofit service providers, and Long Beach City College, work together to support students&rsquo; educational attainment as a foundation for permanent, sustaining employment.<br />
3. The project enables students to focus on academic success and personal growth by providing comprehensive help with housing, meals, case management, behavioral health services, job training, stipends, transportation, and employment.<br />
4. The project offsets the cost of &ldquo;heavy touch&rdquo; comprehensive services by targeting individuals who will otherwise become chronically homeless and have ongoing high public costs. These net cost savings make the project scalable through linkages with public systems for employment services, public assistance, health care, and the justice system.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>

<p>This is an independent contractor position. The compensation range for the position is from $85,000 to $108,000 depending on level of education, experience, demonstrated skills, and earnings history.&nbsp;</p>
