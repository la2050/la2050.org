<strong>Reports To: </strong>Media Director/Program Manager&mdash;Southern California<br />
<strong>Status:&nbsp;</strong>Nonexempt, Part-Time&nbsp;(flexible, between 16-24 hours/week)<br />
<strong>Posted:&nbsp;</strong>Friday, Aug. 21, 2020<br />
<strong>Due:&nbsp;</strong>Monday, Sept. 14, 2020<br />
<strong>Compensation:&nbsp;</strong>$6,000 for 400 hours completed ($15/hour)</p>

<p><strong>INTERNSHIP FORMAT</strong><br />
This paid internship position is part of the LA County Dept. of Arts &amp; Culture&rsquo;s <meta charset="utf-8" /><b id="docs-internal-guid-65b5ea6e-7fff-3cdc-bab4-39e5ecb85a34"><a href="https://www.lacountyarts.org/opportunities/arts-internship-program-students/about-arts-internship-program-students">Arts Internship Program</a></b>, open to <strong>enrolled undergraduate and community college students in Los Angeles County.</strong> The intern must work a total of 400 hours by March 1, 2021, and may propose a schedule between 16 and 24 hours per week, depending on their academic commitments. Intern&rsquo;s weekly schedule will be determined at the start of the internship, but may be flexible. For example, an intern seeking a 16-hour schedule may need to work additional hours at certain points to meet the 400 hours requirement by March 1. The purpose of the County&rsquo;s internship program is to provide undergraduate students with meaningful on-the-job training and experience working in nonprofit arts organizations.</p>

<p><strong>THE ORGANIZATION</strong><br />
The <meta charset="utf-8" /><b id="docs-internal-guid-dd9a6a73-7fff-a8de-c506-44e967f096a7"><a href="https://actaonline.org/">Alliance for California Traditional Arts</a></b> (ACTA) supports the health, vibrancy, and evolution of the State&rsquo;s diverse cultural traditions through advocacy, public programs, grant making, and connections for folk and traditional artists. Recognized for its culturally competent leadership, intellectual capital, and excellence in program administration, ACTA is the official partner of the California Arts Council in serving the state&rsquo;s folk and traditional arts field. Founded in 1997 by an alliance of traditional artists, cultural workers, and arts administrators, ACTA has grown into a $2+ million, statewide organization. Headquartered in Fresno, it also has field offices and staff located in Los Angeles and San Francisco.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>JOB SUMMARY</strong><br />
The Sounds of California Archives and Media Intern is based out of ACTA&rsquo;s Los Angeles field office, <strong>though the position will be remote during the Covid-19 stay-at-home orders.</strong> The Intern will work primarily with archival and newly-created multimedia materials related to our ongoing Sounds of California project, a state-wide research and community engagement initiative developed in 2016 in partnership with the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C. The Sounds of California project explores music and auditory expressions as vital to collective experience, creating a sense of place and belonging in communities. The initiative has been based in three California locales (East San Jose, San Francisco&rsquo;s Bayview, Oakland). In 2020 it will take place in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles, cultivating stewards of place by engaging residents to explore, analyze, create, and share the local soundscape, and focusing on themes of anti-displacement and belonging. A key part of Sounds of California in Boyle Heights is the cultural asset mapping methodology that ACTA has developed to recognize and document the cultural treasures of particular communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Intern will aid in the development of a comprehensive Sounds of California microsite, culling material from ACTA&rsquo;s fieldwork-based photos, audio, and video recordings collected from each of the Sounds of California projects, and will participate in the curation and dissemination of new multimedia collected in the 2020 Sounds of California project in Boyle Heights.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Assist the media team in the development of a browsable digital archive of Sounds of California multimedia materials</li>
	<li>Pitch and develop new feature articles and social media content related to Sounds of California materials, both archival and new (Boyle Heights)</li>
	<li>Catalog, organize and edit audio and video recordings from the Sounds of California collection</li>

	<li>If public health measures allow, possibly assisting with organizing media from Boyle Heights by supporting documentation with ACTA staff and partners at site visits, community-centered recording days, and online public concerts.</li>
	<li>Assist in processing survey data, recordings, and other media collected through the cultural asset mapping process</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The intern will also attend weekly staff meetings, bi-weekly check ins with the media team, meetings with the Sounds of California program team, and weekly check-ins with their direct supervisor. The intern will contribute to ACTA&rsquo;s social media channels, will be tasked with website content updates as needed, and may be involved in editorial content development beyond the Sounds of California project.</p>
