          <dl class='richtext'><p>In March 2020, Opportunity Fund, the country&rsquo;s leading nonprofit small business lender, and the Accion U.S. Network, the U.S. affiliate of global nonprofit Accion that has led a nationwide network of community lenders since 2011, combined efforts to form Accion Opportunity Fund/Opportunity Fund.</p>

<p>The nation&rsquo;s 30 million small business owners often lack access to affordable credit from responsible lenders offering attractive loans and services. Industry estimates suggest that there is an $87 billion annual market gap in loans less than $100,000 for Main Street entrepreneurs. Addressing this gap can ensure that small business&nbsp;owners can sustain their enterprises; drive job creation; and stimulate regional economies through increased wages, spending and tax revenue.</p>

<p>Leveraging the strengths of both organizations, Accion Opportunity Fund will spearhead the development of a national microlending strategy to meet the credit needs of small businesses &ndash; developing new products, establishing new partnerships, promoting research and financial education, and leveraging digital technologies and data analytics to support mission-driven lending.</p>
