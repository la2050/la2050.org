          <dl class='richtext'><p><strong>About Us</strong><br />
The mission of WORK is to accompany families in Haiti out of poverty through good, dignified jobs. WORK is a nonprofit organization working in Haiti to end poverty one dignified job at a time. We work in one community in Port-au-Prince, called Menelas, where 1,500 families reside. Our goal is simple: to place two heads of households into a good, dignified job so that each family and in turn, their community can pull themselves out of poverty forever.</p>

<p>We start by getting to know our families and learning about their assets and needs. Oftentimes it begins with addressing health concerns, as illness can stand in the way of all other goals. Next, we ensure all school-aged children have access to an education and address basic needs such as debt and housing with their parents. Once family members are work-ready, they enroll into our job preparation program and are trained and placed into dignified work. They receive follow up services such as professional development and access to relevant workshops while we maintain our commitment to accompany them until they no longer need us.</p>
