          <dl class='richtext'><p>Alliance College-Ready Public Schools was founded in 2004 based on the belief that all young people&ndash;&ndash;regardless of ZIP code, income, ability, or background&ndash;&ndash; are capable of achieving at high levels. Alliance is now one of the largest and most successful public charter school networks in the nation, operating 28 high-performing middle and high schools serving 13,000 scholars in Los Angeles communities that have been systematically oppressed. In our 16th school year, Alliance has a proven record of success: though 93% of incoming sixth graders come to Alliance reading below grade level, 95% of Alliance graduates have been accepted to college&mdash;including 73% to a four-year university. We strive to truly change the life trajectories of our scholars and communities. Now is the time to join our collaborative community to make long-lasting change across Los Angeles. Come teach at Alliance, where teachers achieve and scholars succeed.</p>

<p><strong>WHY TEACH AT ALLIANCE?</strong><br />
Teaching at an Alliance school is an opportunity to inspire transformational change for scholars and their communities, while building lifelong, meaningful relationships. We aspire to have 75% or more of our scholars complete a four-year college degree. To attain this goal, we provide teachers with the autonomy to adjust their practices to best meet the individual needs of their scholars. We also provide teachers with resources such as curriculum maps, a repository of instructional materials and videos, interim assessments and item banks, one-on-one teacher coaching, weekly professional development, and freedom to innovate. Teachers are able to focus on the individual needs of scholars by utilizing ancillary resources, including English Learner and special education interventions, counselors, and instructional assistants.</p>
