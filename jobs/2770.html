          <dl class='richtext'><p><strong>Organization Summary</strong><br />
The Unusual Suspects Theatre Company&rsquo;s (US) mission is to mentor, educate, and enrich underserved youth through the creation of collaborative, original theatre. A recognized leader in the fields of arts education, youth development, mentorship, and community building throughout Los Angeles County, US&rsquo;s mission powers our vision of a world where all youth are given the opportunities and support they need to succeed. The Unusual Suspects&rsquo; award-winning, participant-driven theatre-arts programs, centered around storytelling through the page and stage, have empowered underserved youth with lifelong skills for 27 years, going beyond the reach of a typical arts education workshop to provide vulnerable adolescents with the hope and confidence to overcome their difficult surroundings and develop a strong sense of agency over their own lives.</p>

<p>Founded in the wake of the 1992 LA Uprising, US has grown from a small, volunteer-led youth intervention program into a recognized leader in arts education, youth development, mentorship, and community building. With the launch of a new Alumni Residency, we now serve 1,600+ participants annually via 7 program models that use theatre-arts education &amp; mentorship to mitigate the underlying environmental risk factors that threaten healthy youth development. Each modeled after our core Youth Theatre Residency Program and reimagined for virtual delivery during our health crisis. US programs collectively provide holistic prevention &amp; intervention benefits and open educational/career pathways for LA&rsquo;s most underserved youth.
