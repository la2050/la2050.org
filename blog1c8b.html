<p><p>
	It only takes a small spark to light a fire. The <a href="https://challenge.la2050.org/winners/">LA2050 Grants Challenge</a> aims to be that spark for organizations with fierce ideas to improve this city's future. We recently caught up with two of our grantees who are doing just that - <a href="https://casala.org/">CASA of Los Angeles</a> and <a href="https://www.changeist.com/">Changeist</a>. Since they first became part of the LA2050 community, they've grown to touch the lives of many more and to foster further connections within, and outside of, Los Angeles.<br>
</p><p>
	<strong>Building Momentum with LA2050</strong>
</p><p>
	“The first LA2050 grant [in 2014] was absolutely catalytic for us in terms of really helping us launch ourselves and our 2.0 version," says Kristen McGuiness, CASA of LA's Director of Institutional Giving. </p><p>The Los Angeles chapter of CASA, a national association that promotes court-appointed volunteer advocacy for abused and neglected children, is comparatively new to being an independent non-profit organization. Though it started in 1978 as one of the first CASA programs, it only transitioned into relying on private funding back in 2010.</p><p>
	“In 2010, we lost all court funding virtually overnight because of the 2008 economic crisis," Kristen says. “For most of the last 9 years, we had very little government funding and had to start doing all private fundraising. So between 2010 and 2014, we were really building that up."
</p><p>
	Changeist, the organization previously known as Big Citizen HUB, was similarly in its fledgling phase when it won a grant from LA2050 in 2016 during its second year of operation. Since then, the Changeist team has expanded its programming to include more middle school and high school youth, and also have been incorporated into Governor Newsom's 9-point plan to increase civic engagement of Californians.
</p><p>
	“It was a wild opportunity that we wouldn't have been able to get without LA2050 first," says Changist CEO Mario Fedelin. “That level of investment gave us a real boost and runway that small nonprofit organizations don't always get."
</p><p>
	<strong>Full Steam Ahead</strong>
</p><p>
	While both organizations are grappling with large-scale problems, Kristen and Mario are also excited to address them with large-scale solutions.
</p><p>
	“When you look at all of [the] pieces that help a human to either be successful or to be challenged in life," Kristen conveys, “the foster care system is probably the greatest hurdle any child or youth can overcome."
</p><p>
	It is particularly difficult in LA County, which has the largest population of foster care youth of any county in the nation. Though CASA of LA has grown into one of the largest CASA programs in the country today - serving over 1,000 children with one-on-one advocacy and mobilizing close to 1,000 volunteers - Kristen acknowledges that they still have much more work cut out for them.
</p><p>
	“We have identified roughly 12,000 youth profiles who could use an immediate CASA volunteer," she says. “We're hoping that in the next decade we're able to scale to serve all 12,000 of those youth by then."
</p><p>
	As one of this year's LA2050 CONNECT winners, CASA of LA will recruit and train community volunteers to stand by youth facing juvenile delinquency and oversee them through LA County's newly founded Diversion program.
</p><p>
	“Back in the day, this might've come up but nobody at the table would've necessarily asked CASA to do it because they would've never presumed we'd have the bandwidth to do that," Kristen says. “Now they know we do."
</p><p>
	Meanwhile, Changeist will be taking on its second city, Stockton, in the fall, and has plans to expand into another Central Valley city in the near future.
</p><p>
	In addition to growing laterally, Changeist has also begun developing into what Mario considers “a fully end-to-end ecosystem." Earlier this year, the organization transitioned into an AmeriCorps program, which will create a full-time opportunity for community members to recruit and lead its youth teams. In time, it'll become a way for the Changeist community to continue the work they may have started when they were 11, as well as a valuable pipeline for these youths to learn how to take on bigger roles.
</p><p>
	Having been recently awarded an Obama Foundation Fellowship, Mario is confident that he can use this experience to further his long-term goal of changing the narrative around community-based work.
</p><p>
	“If we as a society put our children in sports because we know something good happens there, why aren't we doing the same thing for community service or leadership or activism?" Mario asks.
</p><p>
	<strong>Get Onboard</strong>
</p><p>
	Ultimately, Changeist's greater goal is to be able to influence the way people look at postsecondary experiences, such that doing a year of Changeist or AmeriCorps is considered a valid path.
</p><p>
	“Our young people have the answers that we need and that we're looking for," Mario says. “They're going to be leading community agencies. They're already doing the work." Changeist is one pathway, one starting point, to help get them where they want to go, but the most important thing to remember is that Los Angeles needs to invest in this city's next generation to pave the way forward.
</p><p>
	At the same time, CASA of LA is hopeful that more Angelenos will continue to step up and volunteer. “This really is about our city and it's really about connection," Kristen stresses. “The more CASA volunteers we recruit, the more youth we can serve. Not only is it about the more children's lives we can change, but ultimately it's about changing the LA community."

</p><p>
	Over the last 10 years, Los Angeles County has been working to improve the voting process for its 5.2 million registered voters. In March 2020, locals will get to cast their votes through this redesigned system during California's presidential primary.<br>
</p><p>
	Excited to give this new system a try? So are we!
</p><p>
	The great news is that you won't have to wait till March. LA County will be holding mock elections on September 28-29 at 50 locations county-wide to test this system. Non-registered voters, including high school students, are also invited!
</p><p>
	Learn more about how to participate <a href="https://lavote.net/home/voting-elections/current-elections/mock-election">here</a>. We hope to see you out there voting! But until then, <b> here are the five major changes to your voting experience that you should know about:</b></p><p><strong><b></b>1. Polls will now be open for 11 days instead of 13 hours.</strong></p><p>
	There will now be a longer time frame for you to cast your vote, as LA County officials believe that their new voting machines will significantly cut down on issues with crowding and mechanical breakdowns.
</p><p>
	These new machines, developed by Silicon Valley design company IDEO, will marry paper ballots with touch screens that feel like using an ATM or checking in at the airport. Voters will use the screen to review their choices, feed a paper ballot into the machine, and simply press a button to complete their vote.</p><p><strong>2. You can vote at <u>any</u> polling location within LA County instead of a specific designated polling place.</strong></p><p>
	Despite there being 4,800 polling places county-wide, locals currently don't have much choice when it comes to choosing where to cast their votes. This new process will issue each registered voter a QR code based on their address that they can then scan at any polling location to call up the specific ballot they need.</p><p><strong>3. Voting machines will be more accessible.<br></strong></p><p>
	The LA County region is both enormous and multi-lingual. In prioritizing accessibility for all voters, including voters with different types of disabilities and different levels of English proficiency, these new voting machines will feature adjustable displays that make it easy to select from various languages and adjust the text size, as well as include built-in headphones. By allowing voters to submit their votes on-the-spot, this process will also reduce the amount of walking otherwise required of voters at current polling places.</p><p><strong>4. You can expedite your voting experience by pre-marking your votes at home.</strong></p><p>
	Voters living a fast-paced lifestyle will be fans of the new expedited experience this process offers. As long as you're connected to the Internet, you'll be able to access a web platform called the Interactive Sample Ballot where you can pre-mark your votes. It'll generate a QR code that you can then scan in-person at the polling location and the machine will simply pre-populate the ballot for you to review. Goodbye manual copying-and-pasting, hello convenience!</p><p><strong>5. You can both register and change your registration on-site.</strong></p><p>LA County's new polling model will use electronic pollbooks for poll staffers to verify your eligibility in real time. This will allow them to register you to vote immediately on-site and help bar people from voting at multiple locations. This means voters can now avoid the gray area of provisional ballots and show up fully reassured that they're making a difference.<br></p></p>

<p><h3>Beyond Legalization: The Implementation Phase of the LA Street Vendor Campaign</h3><p>
	<em>This is an update on the winning proposal from the CREATE category in the 2018 activation challenge. </em><a href="https://activation.la2050.org/create/east-la-community-corporation-elacc/"><em>See the original proposal here</em></a><em>.</em>
</p><p>

</p><p>
	Since we received the LA2050 grant in August 2018, the
	<a href="http://www.streetvendorsforla.org/"> Los Angeles Street Vendor Campaign</a> reached a major milestone: Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously in November 2018 to adopt a permit system for sidewalk vending, finally leading to the legalization of sidewalk vending within the City of LA!
</p><p>
	The impact of this legislation is enormous. More than 50,000 street vendors operate in the City of Los Angeles alone, representing a $504 million industry. With legalization, we can expect to see these numbers grow as street vending becomes a safer way to make a living — especially for women and people of color.
</p><p>
	For the campaign's core partners,
	<a href="http://elacc.org/"> East LA Community Corporation</a>,<a href="http://lurnetwork.org/"> Leadership for Urban Renewal Network</a> (LURN),<a href="https://www.goodfoodla.org/"> Los Angeles Food Policy Council</a> (LAFPC), and<a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/"> Public Counsel</a>, the Los Angeles Street Vendor Campaign has always been about both protecting the rights and dignity of some of the most vulnerable workers in the city, and providing them with greater economic opportunity. Approximately 80 percent of street vendors are women of color who contribute to the rich, diverse street food landscape through the informal economy — and when allowed to do their work legally and safely — contribute to the vitality of their neighborhoods and LA as a whole.
</p><p>
	Take a look at
	<a href="https://www.kcet.org/shows/city-rising/making-it-official-how-la-street-vending-became-legal"> this piece by KCET</a> that covers the most recent history of our campaign and shares stories of vendors across the city.
</p><p>
	The ordinance passed by City Hall will allow street vendors to do just that, and comes after nearly a decade of advocacy from thousands of street vendors and their supporters. But there's still much work to be done. Throughout 2019, we've focused our organizing efforts on three major components: ensuring the City of Los Angeles permit regulations are fair and inclusive; doing outreach to vendors across the region to make sure they know their rights under SB946, the Safe Sidewalk Vending Act; and, building the capacity of vendors by hosting workshops on healthy food and financial resources to make sure they are ready for the implementation of a permit program in 2020.

</p><p>
	<strong>What's next? Summits, workshops, and success</strong>
</p><p>
	On Friday, March 22, 2019 hundreds of local street vendors filled the cafeteria and classrooms of Los Angeles Trade Technical College. This was the First Street Vendor Summit hosted since we won legalization. It provided vendors from across LA County with several workshops on how to become a successful vendor under the new rules and regulations passed by the City. There were four major topics covered by the workshops:
</p><ul>
	<li>The nitty gritty of the new Sidewalk Rules and Regulations in the City of Los Angeles from the Bureau of Street Services, helping vendors understand where they can set up, how much space they can use, if they need a permit yet, and more.</li>
	<li>How to comply with food safety regulations of the Department of Public Health, who regulates food vending throughout the County of Los Angeles;</li>
	<li>What resources are available to vendors who are looking to build their businesses or buy permitted equipment;</li>
	<li>And most importantly, a Know Your Rights workshop that gave details to vendors on what their rights are under SB 946, and how they can appropriately respond to harassment from many different parties.</li>
</ul><p>
	After the summit, we began a series of five capacity-building workshops. We held three workshops on healthy food menus, health equity and food justice, and two on financial planning so that vendors can plan for new carts and permits. Through this, we were able to provide information and resources to 120 vendors. In this implementation phase, we are learning so much more about the people we have been advocating for; and they are teaching us more intimately their needs, empowering us to ensure their livelihoods are always at the forefront of policy, advocacy, and capacity building. We will host another series of workshops and clinics in late summer and early fall that will support vendors with the basics of operating a legitimate business, including obtaining seller's permits and food handling licenses.
</p><p>
	<strong>What we learned</strong>
</p><p>
	This summit and workshops were not only a learning experience for the vendors, but also one for us. It reignited some of our longstanding concerns and highlighted that it will take all of us - vendors, consumers, advocates, and allies - to make sure that vendors are properly and responsibly brought into the formal economy. We put these lessons into a
	<a href="https://lurnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vendor-Summit-Summary-Sheet-March-22-2019pdf.pdf"> summary sheet</a> to get the word out about our concerns and our hopes for the future. These concerns also guided conversations at the coalition meeting on July 18, where 25 organizations re-committed to engage during this phase of the campaign by working on issues related to park vending, cart innovation, outreach, and continued policy advocacy. The coalition will continue to organize and work with vendors to develop vendor based solutions to these concerns, and we will continue to engage public agencies to work on improving the legal vending program.
</p><p>
	<strong>Digital advocacy</strong>
</p><p>
	To uplift the work that vendors and allies have done to legalize street vending, we launched a digital advocacy campaign this month to spread awareness of street vending by sharing stories of “Vendors in Action." Through highlighting why they vend and celebrating their contributions to the fabric of our city, we hope to showcase how vendors are both entrepreneurs and leaders in their communities. This will activate people who are both familiar and unfamiliar with street vendors in LA. This campaign will be using a fixed set of hashtags in both Spanish and English to reach as many people as possible, and ideally create a social media movement to demystify street vending and further normalize their entrepreneurship and leadership in our city.
</p><p>
	We will continue to define and measure our success through the number of new micro-enterprise jobs that are created as a result of legalization, and the number of existing vendors that are trained to manage their businesses, and eventually, navigate the new permit process. We will also continue to tell the story of the LA Street Vendor Movement, and track our progress through engagement on social media. We will continue the digital advocacy campaign through June, and then have another push in August to showcase new work on rules and regulations.
</p><p>
	We're thrilled to be sharing this critical moment in the campaign with everyone involved in the LA2050 Activation Challenge. This grant allows us to activate Angelenos to engage in and build an inclusive economy that supports tens of thousands of workers, whose entrepreneurship often shapes our neighborhood economies and cultural landscape.

<p><p><strong></strong><strong>Communities taking action to stop “bad apple" gun dealers</strong></p><p><em>This is an update on the winning proposal from the PLAY category in the 2018 activation challenge. </em><a href="https://activation.la2050.org/play/the-brady-center-to-prevent-gun-violence/"><em>See the original proposal here.</em></a> </p><p>Brady is proud to continue to report on our Combating Crime Guns Initiative: Los Angeles. The Combating Crime Guns Initiative (CCGI) is a multi-pronged strategy to stem the flow of crime guns into cities that are heavily impacted by gun violence. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF), 90% of crime guns (firearms that are illegally possessed, used in a crime, or suspected to have been used in a crime) are sold by just 5% of gun dealers. Through CCGI, we are using a supply side approach to gun violence, identifying and reforming these gun dealers that are flooding cities with crime guns.</p><p>The Brady Center is partnering with the Goldhirsh Foundation's LA2050 initiative to bring CCGI to Los Angeles and help ensure that in 2050, Los Angelenos of all ages will enjoy safe homes, safe neighborhoods, and safe places to play. Under LA2050's<a href="goals/play.html"> 'Play' goal</a>, our project applies to two metrics: per capita crime rate and perceived safety. Looking at our progress over the past year, we are more confident than ever in CCGI's ability to impact these measures over time.</p><p><strong>Progress so Far</strong></p><p>After the hiring of our Program Manager, Steve Lindley, our work in Los Angeles accelerated significantly. Steve is an experienced community liaison with over 28 years of experience in law enforcement. In the short period of time he's been with us, he's managed to accomplish a tremendous amount of work. As noted in our previous report, in just his first month as Program Manager, he met with the Los Angeles Mayor's Office, the Los Angeles Police Department, and the Los Angeles area Brady Chapters to introduce himself and discuss strategies to reduce gun violence in the Los Angeles area. </p><p>As a result of these meetings, Steve was invited to assist the Mayor's Office in drafting legislation aimed at providing enhanced oversight of California firearms dealers, mandatory reporting and tracing of law enforcement seized crime guns, and enhancing the gun purchasing public's knowledge of California firearm and firearm safe storage laws. Steve was also a primary advisor to the Mayor's Youth Leadership Council in their 2019<a href="http://louderthanguns.org/"> Louder than Guns</a> campaign.</p><p>Steve and Los Angeles area Brady chapter leadership have been instrumental in gaining support and votes for two important Los Angeles city measures. On June 5, 2019, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously voted for the expansion of the city's safe gun storage ordinance to include long-guns. On June 18, 2019, the Los Angeles Unified School District voted to educate parents about proper gun storage and their legal obligation to safely secure firearms. We hope to continue our working relationship with Los Angeles Unified on these issues and incorporate Brady's multimedia safe storage campaign,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/business/media/family-fire-gun-safety.html"> End Family Fire</a>, into school curricula across the district. Steve is also working with local stakeholders to develop and execute a highschool-based gun safety education program that will activate young adults around gun violence prevention and educate them on simple actions that can be taken to reduce the risk of gun violence.</p><p>In late June, Steve testified before the California Senate's Public Safety Committee in support of Assembly Bill 165 (Gabriel), which will increase funding for law enforcement to bolster its use of Gun Violence Restraining Orders, which allow for the temporary removal of a firearm from an individual who is a danger to themselves or others. The bill passed the Senate's Public Safety Committee and we are eager to see it signed by Governor Newsom. Steve is also working on a public education campaign that targets firearms dealers responsible for a disproportionate number of crime guns recovered in Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>Challenges</strong></p><p>Political and legislative restrictions to gun dealer liability continue to be a hurdle. However, with a legal and policy team dedicated to these issues, we are well positioned to handle these challenges. Emerging and upcoming challenges include building out our relationships and coalitions to assist in preventing further gun violence, continuing to identify the sources of crime guns, activating youth movement around gun violence prevention, and adapting our various national gun violence campaigns for implementation on the local scale.</p><p><strong>What's to Come</strong></p><p>In the coming months, we look forward to how our 2019 and 2020 legislative concepts will be implemented at the State level. We are also eager to see how our the Louder Than Guns and the Los Angeles Unified School District's safe firearm campaign impact the City of Los Angeles. We will be working hard to push forward our crime gun dealer public awareness campaign and our youth education program. Finally, we will continue to strengthen our working relationship with the Los Angeles Mayor's Office and other national and local gun violence prevention and youth-focused groups to maximize our impact and reach.</p></p>

The team recruited teachers, held a Kick Off events, completed the first and second cohort of NGSS Super Training, and conducted classroom observations and Lesson Study Cycles. One of the primary focuses of the training was establishing the foundation for the Next Generation Science standards. Participants learned about the organization of NGSS, identifying what Performance Expectations (PE), Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs), Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs), and Cross-Cutting Concepts (CCCS) are, and how they compare to the previous set of standards. Teachers then explored how teaching with an emphasis on DCIs, SEPs, and CCCs, referred to as 3 Dimensional learning, better prepares students for college and career readiness.</p><p>NGSS Super Training participants were also offered the opportunity to obtain the Beginner Level Certification in Fabrication Technology which certifies teachers as basic, proficient, and advanced in the use of fabrication laboratory equipment for curriculum design and delivery. Every participant was successful at meeting the requirements for the Beginner Fabrication Technology Certification.</p><p>Prior to the classroom observations, an NGSS expert and teachers met in advance to agree on the observation focus and review the lesson plan; the NGSS expert reviewed and documented evidence of good teaching practices, and provided formal feedback. During the Lesson Study Cycles, teams of teacher trainees engaged in collaborative planning-teaching-observation of learning, followed by lesson evaluation and refinement.</p><p><strong>Value delivered to teachers</strong></p><p>Based on the data collected throughout the training, participants found the training to be a valuable experience. Each teacher had an opportunity to demonstrate mastery and an ability to integrate the Next Generation Science Standards and the Fabrication Technology into a unit of instruction which was submitted into a shared google drive folder, for free accessibility. We are excited to report:</p><p>Perfect attendance for each day of the training: 100% of participants attended every session.</p><ul><li>98.2% of participants were very satisfied or satisfied with all workshops.</li><li>100% of participants indicated they would recommend this training series to other teachers.</li><li>88% of participants indicated that they would be interested in receiving additional certification if provided the opportunity.</li><li>72% increase in the comfort level of participants who felt comfortable or very comfortable operating the 3D printer from the first to the final day.</li><li>74%% increase in the comfort level of participants who felt comfortable or very comfortable operating the vinyl cutters from the first to the final day·71% increase in the comfort level of participants that indicated they were either comfortable or very comfortable with teaching how to use a 3D printer.</li><li>69% increase in the comfort level of participants who felt comfortable or very comfortable teaching others to use the vinyl cutters from the first to the final day.</li></ul><p>Overall, program completers acquired the required knowledge about NGSS, thus contributing to the national effort as well as our local effort to implement the new standards one school at a time. Over 80 teachers expressed an interest in participating and 57 were selected and completed the entire training, thus exceeding the target number set for Cohort 2 by 7 teachers.</p><p>While we are still a few years away from being able to measure and evaluate the impact on college and community college completion and matriculation rates, we feel confident about the impact our program has had on increasing students' immersion in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math content. In context, each one of the 57 teachers who completed our program teaches about 150 students each year, hence impacting over 8,550 students in one year who will benefit from their teachers' new knowledge and enthusiasm. Over five years, these 57 teachers will reach 42,750 students! That means 42,750 more students excited and inspired about STEM and fabrication technology. That's 42,750 more individuals who will contribute to making Los Angeles not just a better place, but the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live by the year 2050!</p></p>

<p><p><strong>Saying “yes" to supportive housing for the most vulnerable people</strong></p><p><em>This is an update on the winning proposal from the LIVE category in the 2018 activation challenge. </em><a href="https://activation.la2050.org/live/united-way-of-greater-los-angeles/"><em>See the original proposal here. </em></a></p><p>Since January 2019, the Everyone In campaign has worked tirelessly to site and approve more supportive and affordable housing across L.A. County. With the added capacity we have brought to the housing and homelessness space in messaging, events, and organizing, we have successfully increased the number of units sited per year by 700%. Of the total number of units sited, roughly a third of them are under construction and will open their doors in a few years. The more supportive and affordable units that open, the more people we can bring indoors and chip away at the homelessness crisis. </p><p><strong>Everyone In by the numbers </strong></p><p><em>as of July 31, 2019 </em></p><ul><li>Facebook 39,831 (22%▲)</li><li>Twitter 15,700 (20%▲)</li><li>Instagram 5,117 (42%▲) </li><li>Email 36,139 (31%▲)</li><li>Supportive housing units sited 6,424</li><li>Units under construction 1,812</li></ul><p><strong>The work of the organizing team</strong></p><p>Much of the success of Everyone In can be attributed to the work of our organizing team that cover every region in the county. The organizing team has been actively building community support for over 35 developments countywide. Local residents are getting involved and signing up for trainings to become “super advocates" skilled in the basics of community organizing and messaging. We've empowered residents to build their own local coalitions to address the crisis in their community through hosting events, canvassing, and engaging their elected officials on solutions that work. Our goal this year has been to move the thousands of people who have signed up for Everyone In up the engagement ladder to win local battles. </p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/OjZDT0GZaus">Organizer Series: Meet Quincey</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/irpsx2vwQHY">Organizer Series: Meet Enrique</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/M7gOa_NzFfY">Gather L.A. 2019</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/EynZD-H6jdI">Stories from the Frontline: Long Beach</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/mD6KIyRf5WU">Stories from the Frontline: Pasadena</a></li></ul><p><strong>Engaging residents</strong></p><p>To engage residents, we have relied on our digital outreach and events to cast the widest net to convert new supporters. To celebrate our first anniversary in March, we launched large ads on billboards, buses, and radio spots to build brand awareness. We've increased the number of local events to include The Advocates documentary screenings, a storytelling series called Stories From The Frontline in six communities, and Pop Ups at major community events. We've utilized a texting platform, Hustle, to engage new sign ups to invite them to a local event or have an organizer contact them for follow up. And finally, we've hosted bi-monthly orientations that have 30-40 participants call in during their lunch break on Fridays.</p><p><strong>2019 Campaign Highlights </strong></p><ul><li>Hosted first anniversary event, Gather 2019, at Union Station L.A. with over 500 attendees </li><li>Increased to 13 organizers countywide </li><li>Developed training curriculum to focus on local overview, messaging, organizing tactics and strategy </li><li>Developing policy workshops with Abundant Housing L.A. and Inner City Law Center on preventative measures </li><li>Increase internal staff by 5 employees </li><li>Host bi-monthly call-in orientations to an estimated 30+ people per call</li></ul><p>With the support of the Goldhirsh Foundation, we have expanded our organizing capacity and have new organizers dedicated to areas like Long Beach, Pomona/East San Gabriel Valley, Pasadena/West San Gabriel Valley, Antelope Valley, and East L.A./Gateway Cities. In jurisdictions outside of the City of L.A. we take a deeper look at improving policies that streamline development, provide legal protections for renters, and exploring ways the United Way can enter the rent stabilization conversation. The results of the 2019 Homeless Count showed a 12% increase countywide (16% in the City of L.A.) despite all the work we have done collectively to permanently house and site new development at record rates. Every day last year, we helped 133 homeless people move into permanent housing, but another 150 were driven into homelessness for the first time. </p><p><strong>Partnerships</strong></p><p>We've partnered with Abundant Housing L.A. and Inner City Law Center in developing our policy improvement work in the targeted seven jurisdictions with heavy focus in the City of Whittier, Long Beach, and unincorporated areas. We've worked with L.A. County's Homelessness Initiative and L.A. County Regional Planning Department on the Interim and Supportive Housing Ordinance (ISHO) that would streamline bridge and supportive housing development in unincorporated areas. Unincorporated areas has over 1.1 million residents in 120 communities and, if combined, would be considered the second largest city in the county. Since the unincorporated jurisdictions do not have an elected body, the Board of Supervisors act as their city council and mayor. We just finished community engagement on the ordinance and are waiting for the completion of a feasibility study. We are also looking into strategies to make the Temporary Rent Stabilization Ordinance, an annual cap of 3% rent increase and requiring just cause evictions, permanent in 2020. </p><p><strong>Progress in the last six months</strong><br></p><ul><li>Number of attendees at events: Over 1,800 at 6 storytelling events</li><li>Number of people trained: Over 600 people trained</li><li>Number of policy improvements passed: 5 local laws passed, 1 pending in unincorporated areas</li><li>Number of campaign endorsements: 130 partner organizations and agencies</li></ul></p>
